            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And though that Mystical Whore lives, as it were secure, and sayes in her heart, (as <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7.) <hi>I sit as a Queen, and am no widow, and shall see no
<pb facs="tcp:170105:3"/> sorrow, yet shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine, and she shall be utterly burnt with fire, for strong is the Lord who Judges her,</hi> (a reason given from Gods mouth to stop the mouths of all such who looking upon her present estate and grandure, counts it improbable, if not impossible.)</p>
            <p>If these Emissaries then of Satan and of that Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Whore drunk with the blood of the Saints (who are therefore said to come out of the mouth of the Dragon, Beast and false Prophet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.13.) be so busie with all deceitfulnesse of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and sedulity of seduction, to uphold the tottering Throne of the Beast, and to obtrude to Gods people the golden cup full of abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and filthinesse of the Whores fornications, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that mother of harlots to be the Mother Church of Christ, and that Beast to be his Vicar, because he is horned like the Lamb, though he speaks like the Dragon, how much more busie should the Lords servants be, for a better Master, and in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cause, who are the proclaimers of that everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gospel, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6.) to forewarne Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to come out of <hi>Babel,</hi> to discover her filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and to denounce her ruine; and now in the time of so clear a light of the Gospel to declare, <hi>If any man will yet worship the beast, and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead and hand, that the same shall drink of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation, and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the holy Angels, and of the Lamb</hi> (Revel. 14.9.)</p>
            <p>For detection therefore of this mystery of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:170105:3"/> to all, whose eyes are not judicially blinded, and for discovery of the Lords work, even his strange work, which he has on the wheel of his providence, for purging his Temple, <hi>Dagons</hi> downfal and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons</hi> destruction, and of the enlargement of Christs Kingdom, his victory over the Beast, and his Saints rejoycing, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 18.20.) I have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to search into that rich mine of Evangelical prophecy forbidden to be sealed up, because the time is at hand, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 22.10.) but given to Gods servants, and whereof both sanctified Readers and Hearers are pronounced blessed, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 1.3.) and as <hi>Sampsons</hi> riddle was found out by plowing with his heifer, I have endeavoured by conferring Scripture with Scripture; and by the impletion of what is past, to consider what is to come, and by tracing the footsteps of a revealed way, to shew who is that grand Antichrist fore-prophecied in Scripture, whom many poor seduced souls do yet follow, (like those who followed <hi>Absolon</hi> in the simplicity of their heart) and that his seat is that great City situate on seven hills, which in <hi>Johns</hi> dayes did reign over the Kings of the earth, the waters whereof (which are Peoples, and Multitudes, and Nations, and Tongues) are in a great measure dryed up, and his Kingdome lost its former lustre &amp; credit, being full of darkness, which <hi>makes them gnaw their tongues for pain, (Rev.</hi> 16.12.10.) and that the time is at hand, when (as <hi>Jermy</hi> speaks, 50.38.) <hi>her dust shall be scraped from her, and she shall be made like the top of a bare rock,</hi> or as the Angel speaks, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 18.21.) <hi>like a great milstone cast into the sea,</hi> with such violence she shall be thrown down, and shall be found no more.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He two greatest mistakings in the world, and of greatest concernment, is, the one of the obstinate Jew, and the other of the seduced Christian, the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the true Messiah, the other concerning his opposite, cleer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the Old Testament so plainly pointing out the one, that it's a marvel how the obstinate Jewes should not long ago have known Christ, and no lesse plaine predictions of the New Testament lively paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the other, that it's no lesse marvel that misled Christians so long should mis-know that Antichrist.</p>
            <p>But the alike cause of both these mistakings is, while the incredulous Jew looked for a worldly tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Monarch to come, he stood amongst the midst of them, whom they knew not, who was the true Saviour of souls, even so, while as the seduced Christian looks for an individual Antichrist, as yet only to come of such a conceited Jewish Tribe, Nation and continuance (as the Papists fancy) in the mean time he sits likewise amongst the midst of them, as in the Temple of God, who is
<pb facs="tcp:170105:5"/> their souls destroyer. So that the diversion of the eye from the right object of remarking wisely that which is present, to gaze idly after a misconceited future, has been Satans policy to make the Saviour of man-kinde unknown to the misbeleeving Jew, and is now the same to make that abaddon and destroyer, the Vicar of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, unknown in like manner to the misled Christian.</p>
            <p>But would we trace the footsteps of a revealed way, and the words of a Prophecy forbidden to be sealed up, but given to be shewn unto Gods servants, and whereof both sanctified Reader and Hearers are pronounced blessed, we should cleerly see him to be that Romane Bishop <hi>(Rev. 22.10. Rev. 1.3.)</hi> pretending as Christs Vicar to be <hi>horned like the Lamb,</hi> but by his blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous mouth to be his maine opposite, and <hi>to speak like the Dragon.</hi> The neglect of which inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and taking notice thereof, chiefly now in the time of so cleer light, makes Gods work, even his strange work of a glorious and general reformation, which he has on the wheel of his providence, for purging his Temple, <hi>Dagons</hi> downfal and <hi>Babels</hi> destruction, neither to be so duely taken to heart, nor yet so zealously persued and assisted as it ought to be. As also makes so many poore seduced Christians (like those that followed <hi>Absolon</hi> in the simplicity of their hearts) to abide still in <hi>Babel,</hi> and continue so as they do in following the Beast, <hi>(Rev. 14.9)</hi> whereas after so loud an evocation and proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cleerly of the eternal Gospel, there is a fearful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination pronounced against all such who do so, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his mark, that <hi>they shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture in the cup of his indignation, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since therefore notwithstanding of the false resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the hornes of the Lamb, the blasphemous
<pb facs="tcp:170105:5"/> mouth of the Dragon is now so well known, since like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the retreat from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> doth so cleerly sound, and that the Whore is so deserted and destroyed shall be, seeing also that God has begun again to feed his people on <hi>Carmel</hi> and <hi>Bashan</hi> as of old, and bring down <hi>Babel,</hi> so that her dust shall be scraped from her, and she shall be made like the top of a bare rock. Let none then be so madly desperate, (as she is said to be mad upon her idols. <hi>Jer. 50.38</hi>) as to be like <hi>Lots</hi> sons-in-law, not to go out of <hi>Sodom</hi> till fire and brimstone come down and consume them, nor bide in <hi>Babel</hi> to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of her sins, till they be partakers of her plagues, and follow that <hi>Romane</hi> Antichrist till at last with him they perish for ever. But as the wise men followed the star to finde out Christ that they might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him; So let the spiritually wise in like manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the star of Gods revealed light concerning Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ in this prophetical Revelation, that they may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor him.</p>
            <p>For the detection of which grand Antichrist speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and son of perdition, and of his deceitful imposture of seduced Christians. I have laboured to search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that rich mine of Apocalyptick prophecy, that as <hi>Sampson</hi> found out hony out of the Lion, or the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims</hi> the meaning of his riddle by plowing with his hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; so I might finde out the meaning of this hard part of Scripture, by conferring Scripture with Scripture, and the true history of things that are past, with the evident foretelling what was to come, and thus in so cleer a light of revealed truth, I may shew to all who are not wilfully blind, that the foretold Antichrist is the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> whose Sea is that great City that sits on seven hills, and whose ruine by the work of Reformation is surely at hand, and shall never cease
<pb facs="tcp:170105:6"/> in the determined progress, till her waters (which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready run in a narrow channel) be quite dried up, that (as it befel <hi>Chaldean Babylon</hi> by <hi>Cyrus</hi>) she in like manner be utterly destroyed, unto which work it is to be wished that all, both Princes, Pastours, and People may concurre in their stations with their best endeavours, till the Lords work be perfected on <hi>Babel,</hi> that as <hi>the time of her threshing is come</hi> (as sayes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) <hi>yet a little while and the time of her harvest may come, Jer. 51.33.</hi> when that whore shall be made desolate and naked, and when her flesh shall be eaten and she burnt with fire.

Of which last sort, this Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is for the most part, being a Prophecy, as <hi>c.</hi> 1.1. of things to come, and which were to fall out and befal the Church of Christ from <hi>Johns</hi> dayes to Christs second coming. But yet it is such a Prophecy as is revealed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called a <hi>Revelation,</hi> and consequently ought not to be hid by not reading, or having the same medled with and expounded. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1. It was given to our Saviour as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and great Prophet of his Church to shew to his servants the things that were shortly to come to passe, therefore is not to be hid up from those who are, or account themselves the servants of Christ, whoever they be.</p>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>V.</hi> 19. <hi>John</hi> is commanded to write these Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and Prophecies, and the Apostle tells us, that what is written, is written for our instruction, that we thorow patience may have comfort of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.9, 10.

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.4. Gods people under a fearful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination are exhorted to come out of <hi>Babel,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should it not be known and expounded what that Mystical <hi>Babel</hi> doth mean?</p>

                  <p>Is set downe the quality of the song, and 2. The song it self. 1. Then for the quality: it is called new, for a threefold new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. 1. That one is found worthy to open the book and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close Gods counsell to his Church which no creature was able to do. 2. (as before <hi>c.</hi> 4. 11 For the work of creation.) So here for a new work, to wit; that of redemption, and 3. For the work of advancement of the redeemed who were before slaves to Satan, &amp;c. to be Kings and Priests (passing by the fallen Angels.) As we have it, <hi>v.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>Next is set downe the song it selfe, wherein 1. They ascribe to Christ and to him only all condignity of meriting, saying, <hi>thou art worthy &amp;c.</hi> 2. They set downe the reason wherein they show. 1. That Christ died, and therefore what sin deserves. 2. What sort of death he died, to wit, a violent death such as is appointed for malefactors, (as we are all,) therefore it is said that he was slaine. Next, a bloodie death, there being no remission of sinne without shedding of blood, therefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. it is said, <hi>(And hast redeemed us to God by thy blood,)</hi> 3. The vertue of this blood is set downe, to wit, that it is a redeeming blood, from sin as the guilt, from death as the doome, from Gods wrath as the judge, from Satan as the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean, and from hell as the prison. And as we are thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from these: <hi>So</hi> (to God) Luk. 1.74. <hi>to be his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones, Sonnes and servants, and so should behave our selves.</hi> We see then that Christs blood, as it is a pardoning blood in Justification, a purging blood by Sanctification, a purifying blood of Gods wrath, a pleading blood for his favour; a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting blood from our enemies, so is it a purchasing blood of us to God, and of all good things to us. 4. The persons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed are set downe, not universally, <hi>Every tongue, kindred; people and nation,</hi> but (us, out of every kindred, tongue, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and nation) thereby showing unto us, that he is. 1. A Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour not only to the Jews, but also to the Gentiles, <hi>Omni po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo,</hi> thus excluding none who believe. 2. That it is but some chosen ones out of every kindred and people that are to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: so that albeit he is a Saviour to every sort of people, yet he is not to every one of every sort, but to a few, <hi>for many are called but few are chosen,</hi> thus all are included.</p>

As also to shew that the function it selfe, is a ministration, as <hi>Bernard</hi> wrote to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> not a domination, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. 2. This service is both for peace and war, and so is the service of the ministery to speake peace to the children of peace, and to proclaime war against sin and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the wrath of God against all disobedience. 3. As they are for service, so for cele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ity. Which <hi>Cyprian</hi> observes, that in the space of two hundred and fourty years the Gospel spread it selfe further then the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. 4. For obsequie the horse rides and is ruled as the rider directs, and so should all faithfull Ministers do in discharge of their function as Christ has directed them in his holy Word.</p>
                  <p>Next, this horse is white, 1. Because of the purity of truth taught without heresie, and that it requires purity of life. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the joyfulnesse of the message, being <hi>glad tidings of great joy,</hi> Luk. 2.10. 3. Because in respect hereof the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery is beautifull and glorious, as is said, <hi>Isai.</hi> 52.7. How beautifull on the mountaines are his feet that brings good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. 4. Because it is the Gospel of peace, which it offers to all penitent believers, and 5. Because by it Christ triumphs over his enemies, either by conversion or conviction, as the Roman Emperours used white horses only in their solemne tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs. <hi>Qui candore cum nive certabant,</hi> sayes <hi>Pomponius Laetus.</hi>

                  <p>Followes the description of the rider. 1. From his weapon, a bow, 2. From his dignity royall, a crowne, and 3. From his prosperous successe of conquering, so that by his bow he is a crowned conquerour.</p>
                  <p>First then, his weapon is a bowe, smiting swiftly, and hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both near and far off, the arrowes whereof are mentioned, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.5. and are made to pierce by the strength of the arme, whereby the Gospell and the piercing power thereof is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood for conversion or conviction, when the arme and power of God to salvation concurs with the preaching thereof, as we see, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37.</p>
                  <p>Next, his Ornament is a crowne, 1. Signifying his royall dignity. 2. His victorious prevailing, after a Crowne of Thornes now wearing a Crowne of Victory and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>The last is his successe, denotated by two words, the one in the present, the other in the future, conquering and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, to shew, 1. Where he aimes there is no resistance, but conquered they must be. 2. That he is not like others who go out to war, uncertaine of the Victory or conquest, but he goes out certaine, and conquering. 3. Others are not ever Victorious, but by fortune of war (as they call it) sometimes lose: but as he is certainly Victorious; so is he constantly Victorious, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering and to conquer, without ever being disappointed or getting the soile.</p>
                  <p>Now those of his foes whom he conquers not by conversion, but by conviction or eversion, were, 1. The Devils when by the preaching of the Gospel he silenced their oracles, and cast downe their Idols. 2. The bloody persecutors, when by the courage and constancy of his <hi>Martyrs</hi> the Christian profession more flourished and they were disappointed, and 3. The swarme of damnable hereticks, whose foggy mists of terrour by the clear light of his truth he dispersed and vanquished.</p>

In taking peace from the earth, to wit, that which is earthly or externall, for as for that inward or heavenly peace, which Christ calls his peace, and which he left to his Disciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.27. no man can take from them. Next in killing one another, that is, man killing man, and so being more cruell and brutish then brute beasts are, who kill not those ordinarily that are of their owne kinde. 3. He is described from the slaughtering weapon given him to that effect, to wit, a great sword, to signifie the great persecution that should ensue under ten Emperours, both for length of time, as also for fiercenesse and cruelty.</p>

                  <p>Here also they are said to cry with a loud voice, which cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notwithstanding is not vocall, but metaphoricall, as <hi>Abel's</hi> blood was said to cry, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.10. and as Christs blood is said to speake better things then the blood of <hi>Abel:</hi> so that by their blood that cries in the hainous guiltinesse of the shedding thereof, they are said to cry, or as <hi>Gregory</hi> expounds it, (l. 2. omral. c. 6.) <hi>Magnus corum clamor, magnum est defiderium tum resurrectionis, tum judicii.</hi> And therefore God is said to heare the desires, <hi>Psal.</hi> 10.17.</p>
                  <p>The titles they give unto God are two, holy and true, suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their desire, thus; because thou art holy thou canst not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer iniquity to be unpunished, and because thou art true, thou canst not but performe thy promise to us, and thy threatning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our persecutors.</p>

The beasts of the earth that were created for mans ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and use, are here made the punishers of man for sinne: thus can sin then turn our blessings into curses, and these that should be for our comforts, to be our crossers.

                  <p>By which Angels, Angels of darknesse and (as <hi>v.</hi> 2.) hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angels are to be understood, or Satans emissaries sent out by him from every corner of the earth, to withstand the truth, and to stand for, or maintaine errour, and by inventing and venting of their heresies to oppose the true Ministery of the Gospel and impede the course thereof every where, therefore the foure corners shew an evill that should over go all.

Which Angel is described, 1. From the place from which he comes, to wit, the East; and the manner how, to wit, ascending. 2. From the office he has, to wit, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in keeping the seale of the living God. 3. Is set downe what he does, or the errand he came for, which is, by inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to suspend these four Angels forenamed from hurting earth or sea, till the servants of God be sealed: the manner of which inhibition is set downe, that it was crying with a loud voice.</p>
                  <p>First then, he is said to come from the east by a rising or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, to shew that this Angel is not one of the created An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but that great Angel of the Covenant, who is also the Sun of righteousnesse, and light of the world, <hi>John</hi> 1.19. Next, he has the seale of the living God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.4. And so living, as he is also a life-giving God: his seale also is the adoption of the Sonnes of God. Allusion being made herein to the Kings of the earth, who promote such as they favour, to be keepers of their great seale, which is the highest and most honourable office in the Kingdome, and hereby shewing us to what high honour our Saviour is advanced in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>It is said also, that this Angel cried with a loud voice to the other foure Angels. 1. Thereby to shew his imperiousnesse and Authority over them, with a loud voice inhibiting. 2. That none of them should pretend ignorance of his command. 3. Therfore also he crys aloud unto them, to shew how strong and mighty he is, and 4. How earnest he is for their reformation that are his.</p>
                  <p>Next, it is said, (to whom it was given to hurt the earth, and the sea,) by the earth earthly-minded people, <hi>c.</hi> 4.6. and by the sea, (whereby the world is represented,) worldly-minded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

                  <p>Here is set downe the inhibition it selfe, and limitation thereof, wherein we have first to consider and may see, that these Angels were evill or hurting Angels. Next they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to hurt the earth, sea or trees (whereby men who have onely a naturall life (resembled ordinarily to trees) are to be understood) till we have sealed (saies he) the servants of God in their foreheads.

                  </p>
                  <p>Next, we see the persons that are to be sealed are the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, even as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. these that had the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering weapons to destroy, are forbidden so to do; till they were marked or sealed who mourned for the abhominations that were done in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and as the houses of the Israelites were also, 1. in a manner sealed or marked by the sprinkling blood of the Paschall Lambe, that the destroying Angel might not hurt them, and <hi>Rahabs</hi> house with the red cord, that none should enter to kill any therein.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is a sealing spoken of here, which the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> ridiculously make to be the signe of the crosse, which is false and foolish. 1. Because many reprobates which are not Gods servants may be marked with that,. 2.

                  <p>This sealing then is not any externall action or impression on the body of any visible mark, but a divine and invisible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction whereby these that are Gods servants are sealed by the spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. and have gotten the impression of Gods i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage upon their soul, called, <hi>c.</hi> 14.1. his Fathers name, and so

A propriation, as Merchants put their seale on their owne goods. 2. Discrimination, as it is said, <hi>quis te discrevit?</hi> and 3. Making sure, and for preservation, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. and here</p>
                  <p>This sealing is said to be in their foreheads, the head being the most eminent and chief part of the body, as the soul is of the whole man, and the fore part of the head, being in like manner the most eminent and conspicuous part of the head it selfe, thereby to shew, that the Lords protection of his owne shall be most conspicuously seene, as that mark which is on the fore head, (as experience hath proved true, <hi>in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Israel, <hi>at the red Sea, Daniel in the Lyons den, and the three children in the fyrie Fornace</hi>) As also that the sealing of their soules with the stamp of his grace shall be evidently seene in their profession, whereof they shall not be ashamed, and in the practise of their life.</p>
                  <p>Likewise this great Angell speaking of God, he says, till we have sealed the servants of <hi>Our</hi> God, shewing thereby to our comfort, that the servants of God have one common God and Father with him, who is his welbeloved sonne in whom he is well pleased, as we have the same also said <hi>vers.</hi> 10.</p>

                  <p>It is also to be marked, that the tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> is here omitted, because of all the tribes they fell first to Idolatry, as we see, <hi>Judges</hi> 18. and continued therein during thee c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Next, the tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> here, in place of <hi>Dan,</hi> is taken in and numbred with the rest of the tribes in common, to shew that now under the Gospel there is no more a separation of

                  <p>From this verse to the end of the Chapter is described the Church triumphant, or what is their happy estate in heaven, who are here sealed and Sanctified on earth, and lest the twelve tribes spoken of before should seem only to be undetstood of the Jews, therefore here he calls them a great multitude of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Kindreds, and People, and Tongues. As also lest that the number of 144000 should be mistaken to signifie a definite and certaine number, therefore he sayes, <hi>They were such a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that no man can number them.</hi> And of the sealing of this great multitude he speaks nothing here, (as some would have by the twelve tribes the Jews onely, and by these the Gentiles onely and their sealing to be understood) because under the name of <hi>Israel,</hi> and twelve tribes thereof allegorically he had spoken of their sealing before, and now after their sealing by grace, he speaks of their setled estate in glory.

                  <p>First, he sets downe their posture of standing before the Throne, signifying thereby, 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>Next, he shews how their robes are white, because <hi>they have washed them in the blood of the Lambe,</hi> which washing implies that they were uncleane before, as all are by nature. 1.

                  <p>In this verse he proceeds further, and shews, 1, Where they are. 2. What they do, and 3. Who is amongst them.

                  <p>Likewise the particle <hi>(Therefore,)</hi> being relative to the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170105:35"/> words immediately preceding shew, that this their fellowship with God, and fruition of his presence is by Christ onely and vertue of his blood wherein they had washed their robes and made them white, and no admission to stand before the Throne while then.</p>
                  <p>Next, their exercise is, <hi>Serving him day and night in his Temple,</hi> that is, [<hi>Dies &amp; nox non vicissitudinem, sed serpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem significant.</hi> Aug.] perpetually, without such wearinesse or intermission as our weaknesse and corruption makes to be in this life: which service is said to be in his Temple, not that there is any materiall Temple in heaven, as we see, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21, 22. but there is an allusion made here to the Temple of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> wherein the Leviticall service was continually, <hi>Psal.</hi> 134.1. nor is this service toilsome or laborious, but pleasant and delightsome.</p>
                  <p>Lastly is set downe, their blessed cohabitation with God, and his inhabitation amongst them. Indeed even in this life the Lord is said to dwell amongst his Saints, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. and in them; but this is by his gracious presence oft-times in the comfortable sense thereof interrupted, and like the shining of the Sun obnubilate, as we may see, <hi>Ps.</hi> 22.1, &amp;c. But this dwelling amongst them here, is 1. An uninterrupted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant glorious presence, a clear blessed vision, and a full and plenary fruition. 2. It imports the communication of all good things whatsoever; for where this fellowship is, there is fulnesse of joy and pleasures for evermore, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.11.</p>

                  <p>Next it is said, that the Sun shall not light on them, nor any heate, that is, they shall no more stand in need of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the creature, whereof the Sun by his light and heate is chiefest, the reason whereof is given, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.23. because they receive fulnesse of all good and comfort from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as he shews also in the next verse.</p>

                  <p n="1">(1. Who he is) First then, by this Angel, Christ is understood, as not only <hi>Primasius</hi> expounds, and others, but also the Jesuit <hi>Blasius Viega,</hi> saying, <hi>Sequentiae nisi Christo, alteri apte accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dari non possunt,</hi> Who is here called another Angel, as divers from the former, 1.

Because of the like operation which descends on his Saints on earth for the establishment and confirmation, upō the ascending of their prayers to God which through Christ do find acceptation, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which are said to ensue voices, to wit, of consolation to some, and thundrings, &amp;c. and that is, terrours for humiliation of others, as the twofold operation of the Spirit on the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
                  <p>But I rather take it, by fire to be meant wrath, as we may see, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.2 and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27. Which is not said to be sent down as the gifts of Gods Spirit are, but with violence (as it were) cast into the earth out of indignation, whence it receives the stile of firie indignation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27. Which God powreth out upon his enemies, the procurer whereof to come down upon them, is the Saints prayers and complaints that go up against them: and as the prayers of the Saints ascend before God out of the Angels hand, to shew that their acceptation is from Christ; so likewise fire from the Altar, which descends on the earth is from the same Angels hand, to shew that this wrath on the wicked, and these ensuing judgments come likewise from him, to whom all power is given both in Heaven and Earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This censer also out of which this fire is said to be cast into the earth, is said to be filled with fire, to shew the many and great judgments that were to be inflicted; and as men has filled the cup of their sins, so God had filled the cup of his wrath whereof they were to drink, whence are said to ensue confusion, as of many voices uttered together, or grievous complainings, as also thundrings, lightning, and earth-quake, signifying such terrible judgements to fall out like a fearful storm that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided, as such things are that come from Heaven or

That heresie is like a Cancer or Gangrene, which rises to a great height, as a mountaine when it is not timely prevented, or quickly supprest, and especially when it has great men and Princes, who are in Scripture called mountaines, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 51.25.) to countenance and patronize the same. 2. That (as the Apostle tells us, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18.) hereticks are puft up by their fleshly minde, not contented with the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the truth, but ambitiously weening of themselves, and desiring to be singular, and to have many followers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where it is called a mountaine burning with fire, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that heresie once prevailing, becomes fiery in contention and every other way against all the opposers thereof, seeking their destruction.</p>

                  <p>First then the head of this general apostasie is described here. 1.

                  <p n="3">3. The place from which he falls, is heaven, whereby may be understood, 1. Either the true Church, which in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the earth whereby the earthly sort are meant, is so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as <hi>Carthusian</hi> expounds, and thus he that brags that he is the head of the true Church, is not so much as a member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, being fallen therefrom: or 2. By heaven is meant the heavenly doctrine of the truth, and Gods true worship, to hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish doctrine of lying errours, and to grosse Idolatry, and 3. From a holy and heavenly disposition, seeking things above, to an earthly disposition, affecting earthly honour, <hi>Monarchik</hi> Jurisdiction, earthly riches, and carnall pleasures, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which defection of the Roman Church both in head and members, <hi>Platina</hi> in the life of <hi>Marcellinus</hi> gives a notable testimony.</p>
                  <p>Next, it is said that to him was given the key of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse pit, from which, <hi>v.</hi> 11. he is called the Angel of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse pit, so that as he chan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>This key is said to be given him, <hi>quia ei permittitur</hi> (sayes <hi>Lyra) abuti potestate episcopali:</hi> as the Lord then gives the keys of the Kingdome of heaven to faithfull Pastours, for the edification and salvation of his elect in mercy, so he gives the key of the bottomlesse pit to false impostors, for the seduction and destruction of the wicked in justice, as we see, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2 11,</p>

Because as smoake darkens any roome (as is said of Sun and Moone here) so does ignorance and errour darken the soul. 2. As smoake is hurtfull to the eye of the body, so are these to the eye of the minde, blinding the same. 3. As smoake likewise defiles and makes black, so do these the soul. 4. As smoake proceeds from fire, and precedes the flame, so do these proceed from the fire of hell, or the bottomlesse pit, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the flame of hells fire to follow, 5. As smoak is a vanishing thing and is disperst by the wind, even so is ignorance and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, where the light of Gods Word shines, and the wind of Gods Spirit blowes.</p>
                  <p>Next, it is said that this smoake which arose out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse pit, was as the smoake of a great furnace, thick, black and abound<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

When the Scriptures were closed up from the understanding of the people in an unknowne tongue.

                  <p>These are called so, 1. For their number, flying ever in great swarmes, for which cause the <hi>Midianites</hi> were compared to them who infested <hi>Israel, Judg.</hi> 7.12. 2. For their devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eating up of every good and green thing in any land where they prevaile. 3. They are very sedulous and busie, bussing and leaping from place to place, as the Jesuits and Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary-Priests do to advance and advantage themselves. 4. As the locusts have but a short time in summer, and as in <hi>Egypt</hi> they were driven away by an East-wind and destroyed: So have such seducers but a short time to prevaile, and at last by the breath of the Lords mouth which is his Word, they shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>
                  <p>Next to their denomination is set downe their origin, to wit, that they came out of the smoak; to shew that they were hatcht in hell, and came out of the smoake of that bottomlesse pit, as Satans emissaries, bred by ignorance and errour, and multiplied by the blinde zeale of simple and superstitious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly is set downe the power that was given them, and whereunto it was like, which is said to be as the power of the scorpions of the earth, and which, <hi>v.</hi> 5. is called a tormenting, as when a scorpion stingeth or striketh a man.</p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:170105:47"/>
                  <p>First then, it is said that this power was given them. 1. From God by permission, as a just avenger on such, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had not, nor would receive the love of the truth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord gave them over to strong delusion. 2.

                  <p>Next, This power that is given them is as the power of scorpions, to wit, unto hurt in the generall, and in particular. 1. As <hi>Ribera</hi> sayes, <hi>Vulnera s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

They do this (saies he) <hi>Furtim &amp; latenter,</hi> slily and subtily, transforming themselves into an Angel of light, and as the envious man did sow the tares in the Lords field, so that their stinging is both deadly and deceitful. 3. The sting of the scorpion or danger thereof is not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at first hurtful, it oftest stinging when men are asleep, and least suspecting the same; even so, neither is the deceitfulnesse nor danger of errour, and 4.

It is written of the locust that it is insatiable, <hi>Locusta enim quasi tota stomachus, ideoque quamdiu vivit sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per esurit ac devorat,</hi> So have the Romish Clergie and Court ever been, from the Pope to the meanest shaveling; witness their owne <hi>Clemangis, Petrarch, Baptista Mantuanus, Aen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The locust (saies <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>) is but a little beast, of a middle nature between that which flies and that which creeps, but though contemptible, if there be but one; yet if there be a swarme of them, they are such a plague to a land, that they were called by the heathen, the wrath of the Gods, so are chiefly the Romish Clergie (called Jesuits) compared in Scripture to frogs, <hi>Rev</hi> 16.13 which are <hi>Amph bia,</hi> of a middle nature betweene these that haunt the earth and the water, as they meddle both with Church affaires, and of Kingdomes; and where they swarme and abound, they are the plague of Common-wealths or Kingdomes.</p>

                  <p>And the better to understand what is meant by the grasse, trees, and every greene thing, there is opposed to them, these men who have not the seale of God in their foreheads, who are destitute, to wit, of any such sap of grace, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to chaffe in the first <hi>Psalme:</hi> whence also it is plaine (sayes <hi>Beda) Locustas homines esse, qui non ad foenum, sed ad homines mittuntur,</hi> not grasse, but men being the prey.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170105:48"/> to us, that their power was not to kill the bodies of these who were not sealed. (Nor does the Popish Clergie claime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such power,) But by their venemous stinging of their poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable doctrine, of doubting of salvation, and purgatory, &amp;c.

                  <p>The third limitation is of time, to wit, five moneths, which is indefinitely to be taken, (as saies <hi>Andreas Caesariensis</hi>) to denotate (like <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8.) that they shall not long prevaile, and is allusive either to the indurance of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall locusts, who come forth in <hi>April,</hi> and continue only till <hi>September,</hi> which is five moneths, or else to the prevailing of the waters of the deluge which came <hi>Ex abysso magno,</hi> which was 150. dayes, or five moneths upon the earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.3. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which time the waters more and more abated: all which time of these locusts prevailing, as <hi>Elizabeth</hi> hid her selfe five moneths before she shewed her selfe big with child; so did the true professors or sealed ones like the 7000. in <hi>Israel</hi> who bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to <hi>Baal.</hi>

In the generall then, for the beastly sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as they are resembled to beasts, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12.) so in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, they are resembled to horses or idle well-fed beasts, not appointed for labour but prepared to battell, strong and fierce, noting; 1. Thereby their cruelty and blood-thirsty dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. 2. To shew that as such horses are proud and haughty, so are they. 3. As they are bold rushing forward to battell, so are they bold in their plots, practises and high undertakings, to the very murdering of the greatest Monarchs. 4. As such
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170105:49"/> are well fed and furnished, so are the Romish Clergie, having the most pleasant parts in all lands, well fed, and furnished with all things, by large revenues, donations and daily incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, it is said that their faces were as the faces of men, to shew that they have fa r pretences and reason for them in all their doings, and that they can set a faire face upon matters, and carry very humanely and courteously, through covetousnes (as <hi>Peter</hi> saies 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3.) with fained words making Merchandize of souls.</p>

After one woe, where he saies that two more were yet to come, we see, that God has a store-house of judgements wherewith to punish the wicked, as he has a store-house of mercies to bestow upon the godly; and when one judgment will not do the turne, he has more to inflict, as we see in the plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and threatned, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.</p>

                     <hi>Ver,</hi> 13. Where it is said, that the voice that <hi>John</hi> heard was from the foure hornes of the golden Altar, this teaches us, that the heavenly mysteries and counsel of the Father is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us onely through Jesus Christ, and by him who is that true golden Altar. 2. The foure hornes of this Altar where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, 1. His universall power is signified, and 2. His being before
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170105:54"/> God, appearing and continually interceding for us, serves great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the comfort of the godly against all temptations, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all their enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. We see by these wicked Angels that were loosed, that the Christian name, and specially the true profession and Church of Christ has many, and many sorts of enemies, open and avowed as these, and secret or undermining, as the former, which should make the true members therof the more to watch and pray, and by this to be comforted, that notwithstanding of Satan all his might and malice, the gates of hell shall never prevaile against her.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where it is said, that they were bound before in the great river <hi>Euphrates,</hi> we see for our comfort, that the Lord has Satan and his instruments as dogs upon band, to loose them for our sins, and to bind them up againe when it pleases him: therefore in all corrections we should with <hi>Job</hi> look up to him, and to his mighty hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. Their time of being loosed, for an houre, a day, a moneth, and a yeare, shews in like manner that the set and determinate time of the wickeds insolency and prevailing is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, short or longer as he thinks fit, and of his peoples delivery, as we see in the 70. yeares of the Captivity, and <hi>Israels</hi> being in the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

These wicked Angels, their being prepared for an houre, a day, a moneth, and a yeare to kill, that is, at all times to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their wicked and cruell intents, should teach us always to be in like manner prepared at all times and occasions to pray and performe the duties of our generall and particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings whereto God hath called us, with all diligence and sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 20. We see here, by setting downe the sin of Idolatry chiefly to have been the cause of this fearfull judgment. 1. How odious a sinne the same is in Gods sight. 2. That the grosse Idolatry, and other sinnes mentioned <hi>ver.</hi> 21. was and is the true cause, why the Lord stirred up the Turk to be a scourge to Christendome: and therefore how foolishly these warres that were called the holy warres were undertaken, as long as Idolatry the cause thereof, was not repented of and forsaken! so that it maybe said of Christians, their prevailing against the Turks, as <hi>Jehu</hi> answered <hi>Joram</hi> when he asked, is it peace? saying, what peace, so long as the whoredomes of thy Mother <hi>Jesabel,</hi> and her witchcrafts are so many? 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.22. even so, what prevailing, as long as the Idolatry of Christians, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of that Mother of whoredoms <hi>Rome,</hi> and her other sins, are so many?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where it is said, that the rest who were not killed by these plagues, yet repented not, &amp;c. We see, 1. The graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous goodnesse and sparing mercy of God, that at once he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes not all, who are of a like guiltinesse; but punishes some to be examples to others, that thereby they may be forewarned and timely repent. 2. We see the wicked obstinacy of mans heart, that neither threatnings and forewarning by word, nor the visible examples of sharpest punishment inflicted on others the like offendors, can any wise move, or draw to repentance. 3. We see what a strange bewitching sinne Idolatry is, that can hardly by any meanes be forsaken or repented of, and 4. We see how good and gracious the Lord is, who desires no more of the most grievous sinners who provoke him, but that they will repent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 21. We see that the murder of the bodies of men is joyned with the murder of their soules; and so, that popery is every way cruell, murdering the soules of some by heresie and Idolatry, and the bodies of others for their profession of the truth and verity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Idolatry <hi>ver.</hi> 20. is justly called the worshipping of Devils, so it is no marvell that Devillish sorcery was joyned therewith; as is evident, both in Popes and Priests,</p>

Next he is called a mighty Angel, in opposition to the forenamed mighty enemies of his Church; whom by his Almighty power he shal in the end sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due. Thirdly, he is said to come down from heaven, not by local motion, but by the manifestation of his might and power in this great work which he has in hand. Fourthly, he comes
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170105:56"/> downe from heaven bringing light with him, whereas Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ comes up out of the bottomlesse pit bringing darknesse with him. Fifthly, he is cloathed with a cloud, to signifie his glory, veiled with our nature, and who is said to dwel in a cloud 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.10. and shall come in the clouds at the last day. Sixthly, he has a rainbow on his head, signifying the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of peace which he has made with his Church. As also to assure her, that the deluge of Antichristian ignorance and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which he was to abate and dry up, should never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow the earth againe. Seventhly, his face was as the Sun, to shew that he is that Sun of righteousnesse who was to bring light, comfort and deliverance to his Church, and by the bright shining of his Gospel was to dispel the former smoake of the bottomlesse pit. Eighthly, his feet were as pillars of fire, signifying, 1. His stability whom none can overthrow, or where he sets his feet none can remove them. 2. That he was not only to establish his Church, but tread downe his enemies. and 3. Not onely to tread upon them, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.1. but also to consume them altogether, as it were with fire.</p>

                  <p>Moreover, the weapon of his Victory is set downe, that he had in his hand a little book, by which book is understood the Bible or Holy Scripture, called little 1. Because of the little regard and estimation that many men, and chiefly his enemies has to it, branding it with imperfection and obscurity, &amp;c. 2. Little in comparison of the Popish voluminous decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, counsels, legends and such like.</p>
                  <p>Next, he is said to have this little book in his hand, 1. To shew thereby from whom all Scripture doth come, as is clear, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. 2. That the truth therein he will maintaine. 3. That this is the weapon wherewith he is to overcome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist and consume him even with the breath of his mouth, and 4. That his hand or power must concurre with this book or Ministery of the Word for conversion of soules.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, this book is said to be open, to shew, 1. That no longer shall it be closed up from Gods people in an
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170105:56"/> unknowne tongue, and by Popish prohibition kept up from their reading thereof. 2. As also that it shall be plainly preached, and the meaning thereof opened up by the Ministery of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Thereafter the posture of his feet is set downe, to wit, that he set his right foot on the Sea, and his left foot on the earth, to shew, 1.

THe Gospel and Church of Christ has mighty enemies, such as <hi>c.</hi> 18. are Princes and the great men of the earth, Psal. 2. yet here is her comfort, that she has a mighty Angel, even that great Angel of the Covenant, Christ Jesus, the Almighty God for her, to deliver her, and confound her enemies, in the hight of her pride, for as is said, <hi>Rev</hi> 18.8. Strong is the Lord God that judgeth them.</p>

By this mighty Angels coming from heaven, we see whence and whereby shall be the ruine of Antichrist, to wit, not from the earth or the arm of flesh, but from heaven, and the heavenly power of the Word of God, which is that breath of Christs mouth that shall consume that man of sinne, and that sound of the trumpet that shall bring downe <hi>Jericho.</hi>

                  <p>Follows now at last the third and last woe which upon Antichrist his discovery and overthrow, and conversion of such who are elected, shall quickly thereafter come upon the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded sort, as we have it, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.13. and which woe fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out upon the seventh Angels sounding; denouncing the day of the general judgement, after which Christ Jesus only shall reigne, and take unto him his great power, which till then was not so manifested, and at what time (as <hi>ver.</hi> 18.) the dead shall be judged both good and bad, and each one of them get a reward according to their works. Then also (as <hi>v.</hi> 19.) Gods Church shall be clearly seen what they are, which is not so here, and Christ their head in like manner; when as the wicked may then expect nothing, but the storme of his wrath. This is set down partly by declaration, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. and 19. and partly by way of thanksgiving of the twenty four Elders, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, and 18.</p>
                  <p>The first part of the declaration is by gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap> agreeing in one. 2. These voices are in heaven, or heavenly voices, therefore cannot faile. And 3. They are great voices, because declaring great matters, to wit, Christs assuming to himself, and manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his full power and dominion over all, the judging of the dead, the rewarding of the godly, and destroying the wicked.</p>
                  <p>The matter or summe of their declaration is, that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world, wherein Satan did reigne before as a Prince, and the Vicar of his power, having all the world fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him, as <hi>chap.</hi> 13.8, 16. are now become the Kingdoms of our Lord (say they) and of his Christ; not by any new title or property which he had not before, but by way of manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170105:67"/> to all, so that hereafter they shall not be usurped as they were formerly by such who reigned in and over them, but Christ Jesus shall be only King, and he shall reigne for ever and ever. See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. By this imployment, we may see, that the visible Church may so erre, and the publick worship therein be so corrupt, as there is need of examination, and a due refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the reed given to <hi>John</hi> for m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>asuring, we are
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170105:68"/> taught, that the only rule whereby this ought to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is the written word of God, as the pattern in the mount, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Temple and Altar, with the Worshippers therein, are joyned together; to shew us, that the true Church, and a true manner of worship, goes ever together, squared according to the Word; and by the true worship and worshippers, the true Church is known: so that hereby easily it may be answered to that question, who is the true Church? to wit, where the right Altar is, or worship, framed according to the pattern shewn in the Mount, and agreeable to the reed of Gods Word: there is the Temple, and the true worshippers therein.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Where <hi>John</hi> is bidden, arise, and measure the Temple &amp;c. we see that those who would be reformers of abuses in the Church should have a calling thereto, and then cheerfully and with courage against all impediments should go about the same.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In all this speech, where allusion is to the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets (as has been shewn in the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,) this teaches us how in their writings (for understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other places of Scripture) we should be exercised, and to expound Scripture by Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. By leaving out of the Court which is without the Temple, we see that the true Church is little in comparison of the false and Antichristian, as the Temple and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers therein are (who were the Priests only,) in comparison of the Court, and the people who worshipped there; and therefore that multitude is no right no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of the true Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see that things are farre otherwise in Gods account (who discernes best) then they are in mans; and therefore that to his judgement, as it is revealed in his word, we should conform our selves, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Popish idolatry and Gentilisme we see counted all one, (where he sayes that the Court is given to the Gentiles,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of alike grossenesse, and alike excusing; both which their own <hi>Cassander</hi> affirmes, <hi>(Cass. consult. art. de imag.)</hi> of the first, saying, that the adoring of images was come to that heighth, as never such idolatry was at amongst the very Pagans; and of the other, neither is that excuse to be thought of any worth (sayes he) which is by some now adayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; that this worship is not given to images themselves,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170105:69"/> but to them whom they represent, for this excuse (sayes he) was likewise made by Pagans to colour their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By their treading down the holy city, we see that idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try has ever joyned with it cruelty against true worshippers, as we see in <hi>Ahabs</hi> time, and herein Antichrists practise, who in so farre as he advances the one, he beares down the other.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That this treading down shall be but only fourty two moneths, serveth to comfort the Church of God; that the pressure of the godly, and the prevailing of Antichrist is but for a short and a limitted time, which more then the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> the enemies cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. By the two witnesses only, we see the paucity of faithful Pastours during the time of Antichrists prevailing, and yet by them, (as by the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ophets in <hi>Achabs</hi> time that were hid by <hi>Obadiah</hi>) how the Lord preserved a Church to himself (like the seven thousand in <hi>Israel</hi>) within the bowels of Antichristian usurpation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By their cloathing in sackcloth, we see the sad and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted estate of the servants o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> God during the time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs bearing swey, and which is ever to be expected where idolatry and error prevaileth. Yet this is their comfort, that they are the Lords witnesses, therefore called here (my two witnesses,) who as he owns them to be his, will avenge their quarrel, and at last, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.4. for their spirit of heavinesse, will give them the garment of gladnesse.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By these two witnesses only, who begin this great work of Antichrists opposition and discovery, we learne that Gods greatest works have but small beginnings, as <hi>Elijahs</hi> cloud was, and are done but by a few and weak instruments, (like <hi>Gideons</hi> few ones) that in the work, the finger of God may be seene, and the glory thereof be only his own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 4 By these stiles of two olive trees, and two candlesticks that are given to them, we see the excellent worth of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pastours, and the great profit of grace and light that comes by them to the Church of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where it is said, that they stand before God; this teaches such, both to carry in all things as in the sight of God, as also that they standing before him, he sees the wrongs that are
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170105:69"/> done to them, and has his eyes upon them, watching over them for their good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whereas he is called the God of the earth, and as is said, <hi>Job</hi> 41.11. that al whatsoever is under the heaven is his we see; 1. That Satans usurped claime thereto is false, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.9. and <hi>Luke</hi> 4.6. 2. That all earthly powers, how great soever are subject to him, and he above all to be feared. And 3. That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we have here on earth, we hold it of him, and should be thankful to him for the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. By comparing the Word of God in the mouths of his servants to fire, for devouring of their enemies, we see the divers operation of the Word of God: towards the godly it is a curing word, and the savour of life unto life 3 but towards the wicked it is a killing word, and the favour of death unto death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whereas it is said, if any man hurt them, thus must he be killed; we see that one way or other, in soul or body, spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or corporally, the enemies of Gods servants even in this life shall be punished.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. By the power that is said to be given them to shut heaven, &amp;c. we see the great power and prerogative that is given to Gods faithful Pastours, farre surpassing the temporal power of any earthly Monarch; for to them are given the keys of the Kingdom of heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where it is said, that they have power also to smite the earth with plagues, we see what it is chiefly that brings the plagues of God upon any nation or part of the earth, to wit, the contempt of Gods Word, and persecutiug the preachers and professors of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. Where it is said, that the beasts shall make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the two witnesses, overcome, and kill them; we see that sometimes God permits the wicked to prevaile so farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his dearest servants, as to kill them, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding is for his glory, their honour, and his Churches good ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see that as the Church was first founded as it were by blood, and thereafter propagated, it is no marvel that the restoring and reformation thereof be so in like manner.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All faithful Pastours (and Professors likewise) may see here what they may expect, where Papal power pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth.</p>

                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:170105:70"/>4. Where it is said, that this was done to them when they had finished their testimony; We see that as long as God has any thing to do with his servants, their most mighty and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el enemies cannot prevaile over a haire of their head, till their hour come, as did their Masters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. Whereas the great city is called spiritually <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. We see like manners make places, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to have like names given them, and may expect like judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is said likewise, where also our Lord was crucified; to shew unto us, as was done to the head by the wicked, and old Romane jurisdiction which was imperial, may be likewise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by the members from the wicked still, and the new Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane jurisdiction which is Papal.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. It is said, that they shall not suffer the dead bodies of the two killed witnesses to be put into graves; to teach us, the monstrous and most barbarous inhumanity of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the truth and brood of Antichrist, extending their cruelty beyond death, to the dead bodies of the Lords servants, as may be yet seen in sundry places where Popery prevailes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. By their rejoycing over the slaine witnesses, we see that the wicked rejoyce at that which should be to them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cause of mourning, and which shall bring mourning to them in the end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see that the Word of God which comforts the godly, and is sweeter to them then the honey, or the honey-comb, is a word which torments the wicked, as we see <hi>Act.</hi> 7.54. and as the devils professed of Christ, that he came to torment them before the time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. By the reviving of these witnesses in the persons of others, we see that God, who can of stones raise up children to <hi>Abraham,</hi> shall never want these who shall couragiously (notwithstanding of what has been done to their predecessors) bear witnesse to his truth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the Spirit of life from God which entred into them, we see from whence their reviving, courage and constancy comes, to wit, from God and his Spirit, and therefore (as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> said, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.38.) they who withstand, do but sight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where it is said that great fear fell on them that saw them; we see a strange and speedy change, that their enemies who before were so rejoycing and merry at their killing, are
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170105:70"/> now so terrified at the reviving; which teaches us, that the rejoycing of the wicked in sinne is but short, but suddenly and unawares, sorrow, sadnesse and terror, like that of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> comes upon them, which shall last for ever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Where it is said, that the spirit of life came from God; we may learn when ever we would be quickned in our souls, or comforted let us seek from God his Spirit, who is only able to do the same.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. By these witnesses their ascending (upon Gods calling of them) to heaven in a cloud, we may see what these who are Gods faithful servants on earth may expect, when God cals them out of this life; to wit, a joyful ascending of their souls to heaven after death, and of soul and body at the last day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is said, that their enemies beheld them, as (<hi>Psal.</hi> 23.5.) <hi>David</hi> sayes, that the Lord prepared a table for him in the sight of his enemies: which shews unto us; that the sight of the Lords preferment of the godly so highly, whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised and persecuted, shall be a great addition to the torment of their wicked enemies, as <hi>Josephs</hi> was to <hi>Potiphar,</hi> and <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai's</hi> unto proud <hi>Haman.</hi>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 13. By the earthquake, and fall of the tenth part of the great City, which ensued upon the reviving of the two witnesses, we see the great power of the Word of God, and happy successe thereof, to the shaking of Antichrists kingdome, and procuring the fall of the same.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where the tenth part of the City only falleth at first, which thereafter totally falleth, <hi>chap.</hi> 18.2. we see that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs kingdome, and that mystical <hi>Babel,</hi> shall not totally be ruined at first; but as it rose by degrees, so it shall fall, and the water whereon the whore sits shal be dried up piece and piece, <hi>ch.</hi> 16.12. therefore it is said, that that man of sinne shall be consumed with the breath of the Lords mouth at first, (which is a lingring disease) till he be at last quite abolisht by the brightnesse of his coming.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By some being slaine in the earthquake, and others only afrighted, who gave glory to God, we see again, how diversly Gods Word and judgements work upon men; upon some to their conversion and turning, and upon others only to their conviction and terrifying.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. Where it is said, that the third or last woe comes quickly; we are taught, that although the Lord be slow to wrath, or beginning, yee when once his anger
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170105:71"/> is kindled, (as in plaguing <hi>Egypt</hi>) he is swift in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

It is said here at the last day, the kingdoms of this world are become Christs, and he shall reigne for ever: where we see that howsoever Christ be not acknowledged King over all here, as he should be, and (as <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.2.) that Kings of the earth set themselves together against the Lord, and his anointed, and as <hi>chap.</hi> 17.13. give their power to the beast, as his hornes to make warre against the lamb; yet the day comes, when none shall be seen to be King over all, and to reign only for ever, having all made subject to him, but the Lord Jesus.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 16, 17. For which assuming to himself his great power, and universal dominion, the twenty foure Elders in a humble manner (as has been shewn before) of prostration and adoration, give unto him thanks, as for a thing wherein they have interest, shewing thereby unto us, that all the parts of Christs Kingly office, both now which he exercises, and shall do hereafter, affords benefit and comfort to his own Elect; for which they shall praise him here, and hereafter for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the heavens.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is said, that these twenty four Elders, they sat before God, as before they had walked before God. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we would in like manner sit before God in Heaven; let us with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.1. walk before God on earth.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. We see here where it is said, that the Nations were angry, and now Gods wrath was come, the just judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God against the wicked, who as they were angry at Gods servants, and in their unjust wrath destroyed them, so God kyths his anger at them, and in his just wrath destroys them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is said, that the time is come of the dead, that they should be judged: where we see, 1. That after death comes judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though the wicked think little on either. 2. That after the particular judgement of the soul, there shall be a general judgement both of the soul and body, which lay dead in the grave, and then shall rise again and compeir (united with the soule) before Christs tribunal. 3. That the time of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comes quickly, as is said <hi>v.</hi> 14. and <hi>ch.</hi> 22.12. howsoever the wicked put the same far off.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. At this time it is said, that God will give reward unto

That godlinesse, or the service of God shall not want its reward, nor (as Satan an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered concerning <hi>Joh</hi>) shall the godly fear him for nought, <hi>Joh</hi> 1.9. 2. That this reward is not to be expected in this life, till the time that the dead be judged, and then they shall fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. 3. It shall be Gods free gift unto them, as we have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2. <hi>ratione pacti, non facti.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. These who are to get this reward, as they are called, Gods servants, and Saints, so also, these that fear his Name; shewing thereby both what a Jewel the fear of God is, and that without it we can neither serve God, or be Saints here, or in glory hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This reward is given both to small and great: which shewes unto us, for our great encouragement, what a bountiful Master we serve, who without respect of persons, liberally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth all, and what a rich storehouse he has, who gives to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one abundantly, although they obey his call, and come at the eleventh houre of the day.</p>

                        </bibl> ANd there appeared a great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in heaven; a woman cloathed with the Sunne, and the Moone under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve starres:</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>FIrst then <hi>John</hi> sets down the quality of this vision, that it was a wonderful one; therefore he sayes, I saw a wonder in heaven: yea, there appeared (sayes he) a great wonder: and indeed no marvel that he calls it so; to see such a weak woman, and such a strong enemy, so mighty and monstrous, yet not to prevaile against her, especially she being in her weakest estate, in the paines of her birth.</p>
                  <p>The thing then which he sees, is a woman, whereby is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the Church of Christ: for so does both a Pope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, (<hi>Greg. moral.</hi> 34. <hi>c.</hi> 7.) and the Jesuite <hi>Ribera</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, saying, <hi>mulier ergo ecclesiam significat:</hi> and not the whole visible Church in common; but the true Church, or Elect number, who followed not Antichrist, as <hi>v.</hi> 8. for so likewise confesses the same Jesuite, saying, <hi>Dici quidem haec de ecclesiâ non tamen pro omnibus membris, sed pro electioribus;</hi> which is therefore said to be in heaven, <hi>quod altitudinem dignitatis &amp; sanctitatis ecclesiae indicat</hi> (sayes he,) <hi>&amp; propterea in coelo videtur, quia conversatio ejus in coelis est.</hi>

She is then called a woman, 1. To shew, as the woman had her first being and beginning from man, so has she from Christ. 2. A woman is the weaker vessel, so is she of her self. 3. The love of a woman is to her husband alone, so is the love of the chaste Spouse of Christ. 4 By company with her husband she is fruitful, so is the Church. 5. All her welfare stands in the provident care, protection and love of her husband, so does the Churches. 6. The hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band payes the wives debts, so has Christ payed hers: herein notwithstanding is a great difference between her and other women (wherein she is like the mother of Christ her head,) that she is both a virgin, and yet a fruitful mother.</p>

                  <p>Next, she is saide to be clothed with the sunne, so that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she be weak, yet she is very glorious; by which sunne is meant that sunne of righteousnesse, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus and his righteousnesse, whom she has put on, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. and who is as a garment to her, <hi>tegendo, ornando, &amp; prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendo,</hi> wherewith she is not only said to be covered, but (as the original <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Thirdly, she is said also to have the Moon under her feet, whereby the world is meant, which is ever subject to chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and so she has it not (as many have it) in her heart, but by a holy contempt thereof (using it only for her supportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and maintenance, as if she used it not) she tramples it under her feet.</p>
                  <p>And if we will heare a great Pope his Exposition conforme hereunto, <hi>Gregory</hi> 34. <hi>moral. c.</hi> 7. sayes thus, <hi>In sole verò illustratio veritatis, in luna autem, quae menstruis suppletioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus deficit, mutabilitas temporalitatis accipitur.

As persecution drives her neerer to God, so she rests not nor relyes upon any means that God appoints for her safety or deliverance: but as the Eagle soares with his wings the highest of any bird above the earth, looking to the sunne; even so doth she above all earthly helps or means, putting her confidence only in him, who is the sunne of righteousness, on whom she looks by faith.</p>
                  <p>The exposition of the rest of this verse we have it, <hi>v.</hi> 6. only here it is said, that she might flie from the face of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: not that hereby he knew not where she was, but by flying into such places where she lurked, she eschewed so (like the hid Prophets by <hi>Obadiah,</hi>) his open fury and persecution, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise she had not so escaped.</p>
                  <p>The application of which double flight of the woman by the red dragons persecution of her into the wilderness, to the history of the Church is this: when the apostolicall and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christian Church with great paines, as a woman in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170105:78"/> and under great persecution of the heathen emperours, had at last brought forth a man child, that is, (taking the word col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively, one for many,) a number of Christian professors of spiritual strength, and masculine courage; then Satan short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereafter assaulted the Church by hereticks, which like fallen starres whom he drew with his taile and cast to the earth, sought to pester the Church by damnable heresies, and so to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the same; wherein he so prevailed, (especially by the <hi>Arrian</hi> heresie, that made the Christian world to sob under it, and wonder that it was turned <hi>Arian</hi>) that through the prevailing thereof, and the sharpe persecution of <hi>Arian Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors that patronized the same, the true and orthodox professors were forced to lurk in caves and dens and such like places, like the woman fled to the wilderness, or the times of <hi>Elijah's</hi> flight from <hi>Ahab,</hi> as <hi>Athanasius</hi> witnesses at large in his book, <hi>ad solitariam vitam agentes.</hi>

                  <p>Thereafter when that cloud was scattered and overpast, and that <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, or Christ by his faithfull and orthodox servants had fought by their learned writings and painfull preachings, and thereby had overcome the dragon and his hereticall angels, and as it were, cast them to the earth. Then of new upon the prevailing of Popery which ensued thereafter, the dragon againe began his persecution of the Church, and the elect number of such who adhering to the word could not be deceived: and as he had formerly done in the prevailing of Arianisme against Christs person, so now again in the prevailing of Popery against Christs offices, he drives them through the sharpness of bloody persecution, like the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to flie into the wilderness, and so to disappeare, except a few (like the two witnesses, <hi>c.</hi> 11.) whom God in every age raised up, as, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>To bear testimony to the truth, and not to love their lives even unto death,</hi> as the book of Martyrs, and that called <hi>Catalogus testium veritatis</hi> doth shew us.

                  <p n="4">4.

Look for invasion, be still on our watch, pray with <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 17.12. and resist our adversary.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In our militant estate here, against so mighty adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries this is our comfort, <hi>Michael</hi> the Captaine of the Lords hoste is with us, <hi>Josh.</hi> 5.14.

                  <p n="6">6. As faithfull Preachers are in a speciall manner Christs Angels, so we see that on the contrary false seducers are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but Satans angels, and so to be accounted.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. We see to our comfort, that Satan shall never in end prevaile, but still he and his instruments shall suffer the foile.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. Where Satan is called an old serpent, we see to whom they are like who are habituated in wickedness, and crafty to doe evil.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where he is called, the devill or an accuser, as <hi>ver.</hi> 10. we see whose broode they are who in like manner are false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of their brethren, slanderers and backbiters.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:170105:82"/>3. He is also called Satan, that is, an enemy, to Gods glory and mans good or salvation: therefore who ever by doctrine or practise impaires the one, or opposes the means of the other, they are Satanicall, and like him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He is said to deceive the whole world: where we see then how more prone the world or men are to believe lies or errour, then they are to believe the truth, and to be deceived by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans temptations or baites to sinne, then to walk in the wayes of God to their eternal profit and pleasure.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is said that his angels were cast out with him; wherefore we see that Satan and all his followers, their lot shall be at last a like: debarred from heaven, and cast down into that lake that burnes with fire and brimstone▪</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. By this song of thanksgiving, we see what should be our rejoycing, and duty in thanking God in like manner; to wit, that Christ, his Church and cause prevailes; and that Satan and his instruments, they get the foile.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the former prevail, we see the great benefit to man that redounds thereby; to wit, salvation comes, and strength, and the kingdom of our God to raigne in mens hearts, and the power of his Christ to be seen in their lives.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. Here is a great comfort likewise, that there is such a sweet communion between the glorious Saints in heaven, and the Church militant on earth; that when they speak of God, they say our God; and when of the Church on earth, they say, our brethren; as we see the same also. <hi>c.</hi> 6.11.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. Where it is said that they overcame; to wit, Christs followers; we see under what a happy General the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do militate; to wit, under him who shall make them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly victorious triumphants.</p>
                  <p n="2">2, We see here in like manner the right way to overcome,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170105:82"/> 1. To cleave only for salvation by faith to Christs blood allanerly, and to the sufferings or merits of no other. 2. To cleave fast to the written Word of God only, and the truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, and to no other; as Popish traditions and such like, and 3. In doing this to be constant even to the death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. By this exhortation of others that are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to rejoyce likewise, we see, that the Saints of God think it not enough for themselves to rejoyce at Christ and his Churches prospering, but they exhort, and would have all others to joyn herein with them, that as God is all in all, so he may of all and by all be praised and glorified.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see the contrary disposition of the godly &amp; wicked; that, what is matter of joy to the one, is of sorrow to the other, and on the contrary; which was seen at Christs birth or first coming, and shall be at his second.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the denouncing of a wo to the inhabitants of the earth, we see when it shall be well with the godly, then it shall be wo to the wicked.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Where it is said that the devil was come downe to them in great wrath, we see, 1. Who is the author of all unjust wrath and malice; as was first in the heart of <hi>Kain.</hi> &amp; 2. As they who serve God get his loving favour, but they who are Satans slaves get nothing but his wrath, as their recompence in the end; being first their tempter, next their accuser, and at last their tormentor.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is said that he comes in great wrath, because his time is short; which as it is a comfort to the godly, so it should be a lesson of wisdom: as he is busie in doing ill, so should they be in doing good, because their time is short here, yea, and most uncertaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 13. As Satan is restless to draw the wicked to sinne, and consequently to damnation; so likewise we see he is rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in persecuting of the Church of Christ, ever in all things; at all occasions, and against all, one way or other kything his wicked and cruell disposition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. Gods provident care for his Church her preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is here againe set down, as it was, <hi>v.</hi> 6. before, to shew us; as oft as Satan assaults, as oft shall the Lord defend her; and for new distresses, shall provide new deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. Where it is said that the serpent cast out of his
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170105:83"/> mouth a flood of water after the woman; we may see that it is a speat of spite &amp; of all sort of mischief, which Satan intends and has against the Church of Christ, seeking by all means and machin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tions her overthrow and ruine.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see the Lords restraint of Satan ever, and of his cruell malice, that Satan sends out a flood of water after her, but is not permitted to follow after her himself, for as, <hi>v.</hi> 14. she is nourished and hid for a time from the face of the serpent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. As has been said, for new troubles the Lord provides new deliverances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The evil that is devised against the Church, the Lord turnes it another way, and as is said here, that the earth helped her, he makes sometimes her enimies the means of her preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; as <hi>Pharaos</hi> daughter was to <hi>Moses,</hi> and as of late the enemies own Letter was the means of the preservation of the English Parliament from the powder treason.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. We see that the dragons wrath against the woman breakes out in warre: which showes us, that even so wrath or any sinne harboured in the heart, will at lost break forth in action, as we see in <hi>Kain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see who is the principall author of the bloody warres, and massacres that have been in sundry nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> undertaken and made against protestants professors of the truth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is said, that he went to make warre with the remnant of her seed; to shew unto us thereby the insatiable blood-thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiness of Satan and his instruments: who when they had killed the Lords witnesses, and so many before, as <hi>c.</hi> 6. 10. yet they cannot rest till in like manner they have killed the remnant; that the whore may be drunk with the blood of the Saints and the Martyrs of Jesus; <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.6. and let never the professors of the truth expect other of Romanists.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This seed of the woman is described from keeping of the Commandements of God (he sayes not of the Church,) and having the Testimony of Jesus Christ: by this mark therefore let us try our selves if we be of this number who are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christs true Church; to wit, if we hold fast the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the truth constantly, and make our practise or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation conforme thereunto suteably.</p>

                  <p>First then, <hi>John</hi> sayes he stood upon the sand of the Sea; to wit, as he seemed to himself in vision, and as on a place fit for the sight he was to see, which was a beast rising up out of the Sea: this being customable to Gods Spirit in Scripture, to figure monarchies by beasts; specially such as abuse their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer against God and his Church, by brutish cruelty.

The seven heads, are seven mountains on which the woman sits, and thereafter he expounds who is this woman to wit, that it is, Rome, saying, and the woman which thou sawest, is that great City which raignes over the Kings of the earth; which none did in <hi>Johns</hi> dayes, but Rome allanerly; therefore of it said <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Followes next, how he is authorized and by whom, where it is said; and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat or throne, and great authority. So that we see clearly whose vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariot the Papacy is, not Christs, (which is pretended) but the dragons; whose power which he gives him, consists chiefly in these two, 1. To deceive. (as <hi>c.</hi> 12 9.) b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

To murder and kill (as <hi>c.</hi> 12.4. and 17.) and so to slay the body: and thus like Satan, the Roman Antichrist is a liar, and a murderer both of soules and bodies, therefore (sayes <hi>Ribera,) dedit illi draco virtutem suam, hoc est, quantam ipse habet vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutem &amp; potestatem ad nocendum, ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Next, the dragon also gives him his seat or throne, <hi>hoc est, ut ei pareant omnes qui diabolum regem habent</hi> (sayes <hi>Ribera</hi>) which (as is said of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> Rev. 2.13.) Satan had at Rome, in the time of the six former heads thereof; and now gives it to the last head thereof, as the Vicar of his power; to be the seat or Sea, where all wickednesse is openly practised against both tables, as Idolatry, Blasphemy, Simony, Cruelty, and all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse yea, Sodomy, which made <hi>Platina</hi> in his time, being the Popes Secretary, thus to speak in the life of <hi>Marcellinus;</hi> saying, our sinnes are come to that height, that there is scarce any place (sayes he) left to God for mercy: for how great is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170105:85"/> the greedines of Priests, &amp; chiefly of such who are in the highest place? what lechery is everywhere practised? what pride, ambition and idlenesse? what great ignorance both of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and of Christian doctrine? how little religion (sayes he) and such as is rather counterfiet then true? what corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manners (to be detested, even in the most prophane men whom we call laiks?) I need not rehearse, when as sinne is so openly and publickly committed, as if men (sayes he) were to seek praise thereby. To which words of <hi>Platina;</hi> I will joyn only another testimony of that famous <hi>Petrarcha</hi> of theirs, a noble Florentine who lived <hi>Anno.</hi> 1300. of Christ, saying. What perfidiousnesse ever or deceit, what cruelty ever and pride, what lechery ever and unbridled lust, thou hast ever heard of or read; or in a word, what ever impiety or wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of manners, the whole would in any place either hath, or has had; thou mayst see there gathered together in one, (sayes he): whence it may be clearly seen then if Satans throne be there. And as for the Popes themselves in particular; <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> reports of three who succeeded one after another, to wit, <hi>Benedict</hi> the ninth, <hi>Silvester</hi> the third, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the sixth; who were, as he cals them, <hi>tria teterrima monstra,</hi> beside <hi>Silvester</hi> the second, of whom he sayes; <hi>diabolum secutus, cui se totum tradiderat.

                  <p>Lastly, as the dragon gave him his throne or seat, so it is said, that he gave him great authority; to wit, not by right (for as we have it, <hi>Rom</hi> 13.1. all authority is from God) but by usurpation: and this authority he usurps both over the Church, as universal Bishop thereof; as also over temporall princes, claiming, as the dragon did, that all the kingdoms of the world are his, and he has power to give them as he will. And not only over the body by his penances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but also over the soules and consciences; neither these only who are alive, but also the soules of the dead, of which, <hi>c.</hi> 18.13.

In the eternall decree of the Father. 2. In the promises made to the godly of his coming, and suffering before his incarnation. 3.

                  <p>Next to this exhortation, we have a consolation to the Saints, that were to be persecuted many wayes by this beast, which is twofold. 1. From Gods just retribution. 2 From his end and intention.</p>
                  <p>First, then it is said, he that leads in captivity shall go into captivity; <hi>ac si diceretur</hi> (sayes <hi>Ribera) sinite Antichristum cum suis exultare &amp; persequi sanctos, citò poenas suorum scelerum dabunt,</hi> the reasoning then we see, is from the generall course of Gods justice, whereby he does to men, as they have done to others, as we see in the drowning of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the dealing with <hi>Adonibezek,</hi> which is 1. amplified by an universality of all persons without any exception. 2. By a distribution of the severall means whereby they persecute Gods Saints, and the severall like wayes whereby God shall punish them for their persecution; where likewise we have to note the manner of speech which the spirit of God uses herein, saying, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he goes, in the present, for he shall go in the future; importing. 1. The certainty of their punishment, and 2. That the wicked when they are going on in the course of sin, <hi>hoc ipso facto, &amp; pari passu</hi> they go on to punishment.</p>
                  <p>The second comfort or argument therof is; that God for this end &amp; purpose permits them to be persecuted, for the exerc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se &amp; tryall of their faith and patience; saying, here is the patience and faith of the Saints, <hi>id est</hi> (sayes <hi>Ribera) hîc spectabitur, hîc examinabitur patientia &amp; fides sanctorum,</hi> or hereby is shown, 1. What is necessary or required of all the Saints, and 2. What is proved and manifested in them: that therefore which is both required of them and proved in them at such a time is great patience, to wait till the performance of these things, as also faith to be fully assured that this retribution shall be; for where men believe not, they will not wait patiently; but he who believes will not make haste.</p>

                  <p>To come then to the description of this beast. 1. From his origin, he is said to come up out of the earth. 1. As <hi>Ribera</hi> expounds, because he shall rise from a very small beginning, to such a height; as those things that from small seeds grow so out of the earth, to be tall trees: and as the Pope did from <hi>episcopus urbis,</hi> as their own <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

Because his rising should be subtile, and slowly by degrees; as those things which unperceivably grow out of the earth, <hi>quae crevisse, non crescere videmus.</hi> 3. In opposition to heaven from whence his destroyer cometh, so that he is no more his vicar, nor earth is heaven. 4. As in respect of his doctrine, he comes from hell or the bottomlesse pit, <hi>c.</hi> 9.11.

                  <p>From this verse to the end, the great power of the beast, and his manner of operation is described. 1. Generally in this verse, and thereafter particularly. 1. By fraud. 2. By force.</p>
                  <p>First then it is said, that he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him. Now, the power of the first beast before the deadly wounding of the sixth head thereof, consisted in these two chiefly. 1. In commanding over all, and 2. In exacting tribute from all, (as we see <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.1.) which power in these same two the Pope usurps, affirming, 1. That it is no lesse paine then damnation not to be subject to him. (<hi>Extravag. l.</hi> 1. <hi>tit.</hi> 8. <hi>Unum sanctum.</hi>) 2. And exacting more tribute out of every Country subject to his jurisdiction, then ever did the old Roman Emperors; by making all things saleable at Rome, as <hi>Aeneas Silvius</hi> (afterward Pope <hi>Pius secundus) ep.</hi> 4. <hi>Janni peregallo.

                  </p>
                  <p>In so farre as their own <hi>Duaren</hi> witnesses that in the time of <hi>Pius</hi> 3. that Pope drew out of <hi>France</hi> only, in one year, for annats and dispensations for plurality of benefices (beside in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences and the like) seven and twenty hundred thousand crownes. <hi>(Duar. lib. pro defens. libert. ecclesiae Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canae)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is said likewise that he exerciseth all this power of the first beast before him; that is in the open view of all the bounds of the old Roman empire now subject to him, and his spirituall jurisdiction; and to those that retaine the stile and claime to be the successors of the old Roman Emperors. And he causeth the earth and them that dwell therein, that is, the earthly sort of men who savour nothing else but the earth and earthly things, to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was

                  <p>This number also of the beast, is in the preceding verse called the number of his name; by which name (as <hi>Ribera</hi> sayes) is not to be meant his proper name given him at first by his parents, but his name of that dignity whereto he shal ascend.</p>

                  <p n="7">7. Hereby also we see, that the godly in all ages have had but one only way to be saved; to wit, by faith in the merit and vertue of Christs death, which extended it self to all

                  <p>Followes now the second part of the chapter; to wit, the breaking forth at last of the light of the Gospel, by the faithfull preaching thereof by the revived witnesses; to the downfall of mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> and clearing of sunne &amp; aire, that were so long obtuscate and darkened, by that smoke that arose out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse pit, as we have it, <hi>c</hi> 9.2.</p>
                  <p>This is said to be done by three Angels, and their three severall proclamations, the number of three being a full and compleat number of witnesses; and thereby signifying that the Lord should stirre up after his two or few first witnesses killed by Antichrist, <hi>c.</hi> 11.7.

                  <p>Next, of this first Angel it is said, that he did fly in the midst of heaven. 1. By heaven frequently the true Church being meant, for the reasons before specified, as by the earth in opposition, the earthly sort are signified; this showes then that these men; and not Antichrists locusts, are the pastours of the true Church, as also from whence they have their calling. 2. This Angel is said to fly in the midst of heaven. 1. To shew the alacrity and diligence of these pastours and teachers in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords work. 2. The celerity or swift passage that the light of the Gospell shall have by Gods blessing on their paines, which the Apostle exhorts the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.1. to pray for on their part, <gap reason="foreign">

Because the truth therein contained, is of everlasting indurance, one jot whereof shall not perish, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 25.) so that it is great folly to the enemies thereof to oppose the same, or seek the overthrow thereof; and wherein as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Next, this Angel is said to preach this Gospel to them that dwell on, the earth, the same before being clasped and sealed up, as that book, <hi>c.</hi> 5.1. in an unknown tongue, and under strait prohibition that laicks should not read the same; and images the work of errours. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.15. and a teacher of lyes, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.18. with mens traditions and lying legends being substitute in its place.</p>

                     </gap>in we have. 1. The manner. 2. The matter thereof. The manner is with a loud voice, denotating, courage, fervency and freedome; therefore (sayes <hi>Ribera) prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicabitur magna contentione animi propter rei ipsius magnitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, &amp; ut nomen latere possit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, the matter is. 1. To feare God, as if he would say (sayes <hi>Ribera) ne temeatis Antichristum aut ejus minas,</hi> feare nor Antichrist any more, his Papall curses, his fained pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, or bloody cruelty, who has power only to kill the body;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170105:103"/> but feare God with that reverentiall feare, as Angels feare him, and with that filial feare, and of a holy solicitude where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the godly feare him.</p>
                  <p>Next, give glory to him, the glory of our free election, not for foreseen works, the glory of our effectuall vocation; not by freewill, the glory of justification; nor by any righteousness in us, the glory of our sanctification, without any merit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity and the work of our glorification, without any merit of condignity. No glory then in the whole work of our salvation, in part or whole is to be given or ascribed to our selves or others, to Saint or Angel, but to God alone; and this is the only true doctrine of this everlasting Gospel.</p>
                  <p>The reason why all glory should be given to God, is set downe to be this, for the hour of his judgement is come; to wit, whereby he is to judge and punish Antichrist and all his followers, who sacrilegiously before had defrauded God of his glory, and ascribed it partly to himself blasphemously, and partly to others, of which judgement we have, <hi>c.</hi> 15.4.18.4. &amp; 8. &amp; 19.2. Seeing therefore that the hour of his judging these who had robbed him of his glory was come, &amp; that he was not any more to endure that indignity unpunished severely; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he exhorts all by his faithful preachers to give him his own glory, wherein being a jealous God he will share with no other.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, (sayes this Angel) worship him that made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e dead sensless creatures, which howsoever they would excuse by a distinction of <hi>Latria</hi> and <hi>Dulia,</hi> yet that of <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.8. fully condemnes them, where the Apostle charges the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that in the time when they knew not God, they gave <hi>Dulia,</hi> or religious service to those who by nature were not gods.</p>
                  <p>From which proclamation of the Angels, which containes the summe of the Gospel, we reason against Popery, thus. That is true religion only according to the Gospel, which gives all religions feare, glory and worship to God alone. But
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170105:103"/> such is not Popery, because (as has been said) it gives not all the glory of mans salvation to God, but admits co-partners, man himself has merits and satisfactions, the merits and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions of others, as of supererogation, and specially the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary;</hi> to whose milk and mercy they ascribe as much as to Christs blood and merit.</p>
                  <p>Neither worship they the creature only, but likewise many sensless creatures, being therein more sensless themselves, as has been already said; whence it followes, that the Popish religion is not the true religion according to the Gospel.</p>

                     </gap>ll before the ark when it came in into his Temple, and the walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> fell upon the blasts of the ramme-horn-trumpets. First then we have to consider how this word <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> is to be taken; whereunto <hi>Ribera</hi> and all Romanists agree, <hi>non hic proprie accipi, sed figurate</hi> (sayes he) so that it is not the old Chaldean, but the new mysticall <hi>Babylon</hi> that is here meant. Next we have to consider what this <hi>Babylon</hi> figureth, or is understood thereby. The Rhemists and some others would have it to signifie the city or whole company of the wicked, over which Satan rules, and which is opposite to the city of God, the new <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or society of the godly; but <hi>Ribera</hi> refutes this by three strong arguments, saying. 1. This <hi>Babel</hi> made all nations drunk with the wine of her fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and what a sense were this, the whole company of the wicked, made the whole company of the wicked (to wit all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) drunk. 2. When <hi>Babel</hi> shall be destroyed, these who committed fornication with her shall stand a farre off and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her, therefore they must be without her, and not the same with her, nor the destruction of both in one hour, as is said,

                     <hi>c.</hi> 18.10, 3. How can the whole company of the wicked be said to sit on seven hills, and to have ten Kings that shall be their supporters, and differing from them? Therefore the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits themselues are forced to confesse that by Babylon here, and elsewhere in this prophecy Rome is to be understood, which <hi>Viega</hi> and <hi>Ribera</hi> plainly affirmes, saying, <hi>Romae conveniunt omnia aptissime quae in hoc libro de Babylone dicuntur, &amp; illud imprimis quod alii convenire non potest, septem capita, septem montes sunt, super quos mulier sedet;</hi> and againe, <hi>nam si quaedam ex singulis</hi> (sayes he) <hi>vel in congregationem malorum, vel in aliam urbem convenire possunt, omnia profecto nisi in Romam non conveniunt.

                  <p>The next then which we have to find out, is, Rome of what time is it to be understood; and first <hi>Bellarmin</hi> who proves by many testimonies of scripture and Father<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

They set downe the causes of this totall and finall ruine of Rome in the latter dayes, that the same are the like causes which provoked God to wrath against heathen Rome; to wit.

                  <p>It rests then, if Rome under the Papacy be guilty of the like sinnes; to wit, idolatry and perlecution of Gods true worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; whereof it was guilty under the Roman Emperours, thence then it will follow (if this be proved) that Rome under the Papacy is now the seat of Antichrist, and that mysticall Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel here spoken of, which under the said Papacy as the last head thereof shall with the same go to utter destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>First then that Rome under the Papacy is guilty of idolatry is more nor clear. 1. By their doctrine. 2. By their practise, first then this is the doctrine of the Roman Church concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing images, to give them religious adoration; as it was decreed in the late councell of Trent, under <hi>Pius</hi> the 4. <hi>Sess.</hi> 9. and that they ought to be worshipped properly, that is, as they are considered in themselves, so that the worship stayeth it self in the image, for if the image) sayes <hi>Bellarmin</hi> (were not to be worshipped but impropperly; to wit, because before it, in it, or by it, that which it represents is adored; then surely it might be simply denyed (sayes he) that images should be worshipped at all. (<hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>de imag. c.</hi> 21 <hi>&amp;.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>Yea moreover they teach that images should be worshipped with that same worship, as those whom they represent; and therefore the images of God or Christ with Latria, for so does all their schoolmen almost, teach (sayes their Bishop <hi>Peresius</hi>) as <hi>Aquinas p.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 25. <hi>art.</hi> 3. <hi>Alex. p.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 30. <hi>art. ult.

                  <p>Next their practise is such, that as their owne <hi>Cassander</hi> sayes. It is more nor manifest, then can be exprest by words, that the worship of images is come to that height of adoration, that the very Pagans have given to their idols (sayes he) neither is it of any worth; the excuse which some pretend, that they give this worship not to the images, but to them whom they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: for this colour (sayes he) the Pagans also used for their idolatry, as we see in <hi>Arnobus,</hi> and <hi>Augustin l.</hi> 3. <hi>de doct.

                  <p>Follows here the third Angels proclamation, wherein we have, 1. The manner, 2. The matter thereof. First, then the manner is with a loud voice, noting thereby, 1.

The obstinate disposition of seduced Papists for the most part, who are so deaf as it were, to such threatnings or forewarnings, that the same must be uttered with a loud voice.</p>

                  <p>Here then we have in this denunciation, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine anathema tacitly opposing (as it were) that papal anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma used against the Professors of the truth, when he accurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them all on the <hi>Thursday</hi> before <hi>Easter</hi> yeerly. 1.

                  <p>First, then that which is denounced is that as they drank of sinne, which was the wine of <hi>Babylons</hi> fornication, so they should drink of punishment; wine for wine, but wine of the wrath of God. It was poysonable sweet wine that they drank first, but this shall be sharp and soure wine which they shall drink of next, and most justly such, because, as the Lord sayes, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.

                  <p>Secondly, the quality of this wrath, is, without mixture, to wit, of any mercy, therefore (says <hi>Ribera) non erat mistum divinis miserationibus</hi> Whereas the cup that the Lord gives to his own full their sins, is for their mixture, as the Psalmist speaks, <hi>Psalme</hi> 75.8. temper'd by his Fatherly and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal hand with the sweetnesse of mercies, and comfort in the end.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the measure of it is a cup of indignation, full to the brim, because of their filling the cup of their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein in like manner the Lord shews a great difference between his punishing of the wicked in wrath, and the correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own in love; upon whom he will lay no more then they are able to beare, and whom ever he corrects in mercy and measure.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the effect of their drinking of this cup of the Lords indignation, is torment, and that in the highest degree, as of burning by fire, joyned with brimstone as the fewel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which is sa d to be, 1. Most noysom to the eyes. 2. Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the smell. And, 3.

                  <p>Fifthly, this their tormenting shall be in the presence of the holy Angels, and of the Lamb, 1. Of the holy Angels in whose sight they sinned, and in whose sight they should be punished. And 2.

                  <p>Follows here the fourth part of the Chapter, wherein after the preceding desciption of the blessed estate of the godly, is set down the woful estate of the wicked, and the time when they shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and be cast themselves into the great wine-press thereof; as we have it <hi>v</hi> 19. hereafter, which time is the time of the Lords coming to judgement, who is here described, together with his reapers, whom he shall use for reaping of this great harvest.</p>
                  <p>First then; we have the Judge described. 1. From his forme or shape, like to the Sonne of man. 2. From his place and posture of judgement sitting on a white cloud 3.

                     </gap> be one like to the Sonne of man, so speaking of Christ as he appeared in vision, therefore sayes <hi>Ribera semper solet in rebus quas vidit dicere, quasi aut similis, quoniam ipsas non videbat visione illa prophetica, sed earum simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the place where he sees him, is a white cloud, noting thereby 1 That it was he, of whom <hi>Daniel</hi> fore-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied, <hi>c.</hi> 7.13. that at the last day was to come in the clouds of heaven to judge the world, as himself sayes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.30. then shall they see the Sonne of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 2. It is on a white cloud, as <hi>c.</hi> 20.11. his Throne is called a white Throne, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

Signifying thereby his posednesse, and voidnesse of passion or perturbation as all Judges ought to have in the act of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. His Majesty and Authority, sitting not only as a Judge on the tribunal, but as we see by his royal ornament of a Crown, as a King on his Throne, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, his royal ornament is a Crown, to shew, as is said, <hi>c.</hi> 19 16. That he is King of kings, and Lord of lords, and as <hi>Daniel</hi> speaks, <hi>c.</hi> 7.14. that there is given to him dominion and glory, and a Kingdome, and his dominion is an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dominion, which shall not passe away, and his Kingdom, that which shall not be destroyed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, his instrument that he has in his hand, fit for his work in hand of reaping the earth, is a sickle, his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment properly being likned thereto, because as it is circular and compasseth about that which it is to cut down, so shall the Lords judgement close and compasse about all the wicked in that day, so that they shall not be able to flee, nor escape it, as the Psalmist shews, <hi>Ps.</hi> 139.8.</p>
                  <p>Also it is a sharp sickle, signifying thereby the qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

A heavenly Temple hereafter, for this cause he is said to come out of the Temple, to signifie, that this his desire is the common and fervent desire of all the glorified Saints whom (as coming from them) he does repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
                  <p>This Angel is said to cry with a loud voice, signifying thereby the fervency of his desire, and that which he desires from him who sits upon the white cloud, in the place of such eminency and glory, is, that he would thrust in his sickle and reap, that is, that he would come to the general judgement of all men, the reason is, because it was now high time, for the harvest of the earth is ripe, which words seem to have allusion to <hi>Joel</hi> 3.13. where the same similitude of the harvest, and vintage that are used in this Chapter, is there both set down and expounded, saying, put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe, come get you down for the presse is full, the sats over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow, for the wickednesse is great. We see then by the harvest of the earth, that it is ripe, is meant, that the wickednesse of the earth is at an height, therefore sayes our Saviour: <hi>When the Sonne of man cometh, shall he finde fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>What the harvest is then, and who are the reapers; our Saviour doth best expound, saying, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.39. the harvest is the end of the world, and the Angels are the reapers, he being always the princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>efore it is said, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.31. and he shall send his Angels with a great sound of a Trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the soure windes, from one end of heaven to another. As also <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.41.</p>

                  <p>And they shall gather in like manner out of his Kingdome all that offend, and them which do iniquity. And he shall separate them one from another, as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats, and these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into eternal life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.32, 46. Here then we have the reason of this similitude of the harvest and reaping thereof, whereunto the end of the world and general judgement is compared. 1. As the harvest time is when the corne is ripe, even so shall that day come, when the iniquity of the wicked is at an height, and the number of the Saints of God are compleated, both which we see ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, <hi>c.</hi> 6.11. 2. As at harvest time the corne is separate from the earth by reaping, so shall all mankinde be by the Angels forenamed gathering, and presenting them to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 3. As there is a separation of the good graine from the tares, so shall there be of the godly from the wicked. And, 4. As the good grain is laid up in the barne or garner, but the tares are cast in the fire to burn, as we see, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.40. so shall the godly be carried into heaven as the everlasting Mansion, but the wicked shall be cast into hells fire, there to be tormented for ever.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>This winepresse also, which is called great, because then all the wicked shall be cast therein, is said to be trodden, <hi>quia Deus malos tum premet,</hi> (sayes <hi>Ribera) quemadmodum uvae praelo praemuntur,</hi> as we see, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.3. without the City, that is, being fully then separate, as chaff from the wheat, or sheep from the goats, and debarred from that heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> for (as is said, <hi>c.</hi> 22.15.) Without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whooremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth or maketh a lie.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, it is said, that blood came out of the winepresse, even to the horse bridles for the space of a thousand and six hundreth furlongs, which will be about two hundred English or Scots miles, by this blood the wine being signified that comes out of the pressed berries, because it is red and like unto blood, and is so called usually in Scripture, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.11. When speaking of <hi>Judah,</hi> old <hi>Jacob</hi> sayes, he washed his garments in wine, and his cloaths in the blood of grapes, and again, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.14. <hi>Moses</hi> speaking of Gods goodnesse to <hi>Israel</hi> he sayes, that he did drink the pure blood of the grape. Then we have to consider what this wine is that comes out of the winepresse, and why by such an hyperbolick speech it is said to come forth in so great abundance. 1. Then the tenth verse tells us that this wine is the wrath of God, and the cup of his indignation without any mixture of mercy, which all those shall drink of that worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in their forehead or hand. 2. The hyperbolick expression of the coming out of it so abundantly in height, as it were to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170105:112"/> horse bridles, and in breadth or length one thousand and six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred furlongs, is to shew that it shall be such a deluge and great inundation of Gods wrath, that they should not only drink ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as <hi>v.</hi> 10. but also swim therein, as they did in their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in this life, and as they shed the blood of the Saints of God abundantly.</p>
                  <p>These two Metaphors then of the harvest and vintage sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie one thing, and the vision is diversly thus set down and doubled (as <hi>Joseph</hi> said of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dream) to shew the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty thereof.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. His posture of standing, as <hi>Steven</hi> saw him, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.56. teaches us how ready he is to do all that can contribute or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with her good or comfort.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170105:112"/> in prayer and praise spiritually performed, is a heavenly exercise, which like thunder sounds loud in Gods ears, and ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. By the noise of many waters, and harping of Harps, we see the sweet harmony of the true Church and all the members thereof, what different tongue or Nation soever they be of, in the unity of one faith, and sincerity of one wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. Where it is said that they did sing, we see that the Saints in their greatest sufferings and pressures have inward joy and peace, which makes them rejoyce and sing, as we see, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. the reason whereof is the honour that they have thereby, as also (as our Saviour shews, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.12.) the great benefit that they reap.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is called a new song for a new benefit, which teaches us in like manner, as God renues his benefits to us, that we also should renue our thankfulnesse.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are said to sing the same before the Throne, which teaches us whatever worship we performe, let us ever do the same as in Gods presence in reverence and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. None could learn this song, but the 144000, that were redeemed from the earth, whereby we see that the carnal man understands not the things of God, nor can worship him aright, wanting the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The godly are called redeemed ones, as <hi>Peter</hi> shews by a precious price, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. which should teach us that we are no more our own but Christs, and should not sell our selves again unto any wickednesse.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are said to be redeemed from the earth, therefore in our affection we should not cleave thereto.</p>

They are said to be such who have not defiled themselves with women, that is, spiritually committed whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which teaches us that Idolatry is a sin of filthinesse, and an idolatrous Church is a filthy whoore, unworthy to claim to as a mother by any.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are said to be Virgins, shewing us thereby who are the true Church and chaste Spouse of Christ, even those onely who give all Religious worship to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, of whom it may be said, <hi>paret &amp; patet Uni.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. By calling them the first fruits which were holy to the Lord, we see the special interest that the Lord has to the godly beyond all others, as his peculiar people, portion and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, whom he will ever therefore care for and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. Where it is said, in their mouth was found no guile, we see that sincerity of heart and speech without guile or hypocrisie, is one of the sure marks whereby a true Christian is known, few of which sort are now to be found.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is said, that they are without fault before the Throne of God, which shews unto us the great comfort that the godly have specially in the day of death, and of their appearance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in judgement.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Seeing his flying in the midst of heaven, denotates his cheerful and diligent discharge of his message, let all true Pastors imitate him herein.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whereas the Gospel which he preaches is called everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; this serves not only to stop their mouths, who calls our Religion a new Religion, but also answers their question who asks where the same was before <hi>Luther?</hi> to wit, it was and is contained in the everlasting Gospel of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see what only ought to be taught by all faithful Pastours, to wit, not mens traditions, lying legends, or such like, but only Christs eternal Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see the universality of grace and salvation to all N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. The Gospel being the wisdom of God, he exhorts men therefore first to feare God, which is the beginning of wisdome, therefore without this let none think they have true wisdome, or can justly claime to the promises of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He sayes also, give glory to him where we have a cleer mark of a true Teacher, who teaches that we should give all the glory both of grace or sanctification here, or of glorification and salvation hereafter only to God alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He sayes, for the houre of his judgement is come; whereby we see that God has a set and a determinate time for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of his own, and judging the wicked, which though they put it far from them, yet it shall come and shall not faile, no not in an hour.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He exhorts also to worship God who created all things; where we have another mark of a true Teacher; who teaches all religious Worship to be given to the Creator, and not to the creature.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Where it is said that he made heaven, and earth, and sea, and fresh waters: this teaches us, whatsoever good or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort we have from these for the necessity of this present life, that to him as the Creator we should give the praise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. Where it is said by this Angel after the preaching of the former, that <hi>Babylon</hi> is fallen, we see that it is the powerful and zealous preaching of the everlasting Gospel, that is the ruine of Antichrist, it being the breath of the Lords mouth wherby he is consumed, which makes him so to rage and perese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the same.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Rome</hi> is here called <hi>Babylon,</hi> (as has been proved) we see then, that a like sins makes places or persons to get the like names as we shewed before on <hi>c.</hi> 11.8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where he sayes, <hi>Babylon</hi> is fallen, we may learn that her total and final ruine shall as surely come to passe as if it were already performed, for as the Prophet speaketh. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.33 the time of her threshing is come; yet a little while and the time of her harvest sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l come.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 He renders this as the reason of her fall, because she made all Nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170105:114"/> which shews unto us the equity of the Lords proceedings, never punishing without a just cause.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see here when <hi>Rome</hi> proves to be this <hi>Babylon,</hi> to wit, when claiming to be a Catholick mother and mistresse, she propagates every where her doctrine of idolatry, which is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual fornication and whoredome, aluring and inebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating people thereby, as is cleerly proved under the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By all Nations, their drinking the wine of her fornication, we see wherunto the natural inclination of sensual man is bent, to wit, to errour rather and idolatry, then to truth and Gods true worship.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We see the cause of the obstinacy of most who are Popish, to be this, they are drunk as it were with wine, and therefore reject all right information.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Here likewise we see their grosse blindnesse and stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, to wit, that they drink in such a filthy drink, as wine of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, as also such a fearful drink as wine of wrath, or Gods indignation.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Because of her making all Nations drink of such a wine, it is said, <hi>Babylon</hi> is fallen, that great City, which shews unto us, that falling in sinne is the cause of many great falls, of the Angels, of the world, of Kingdoms, of Cities and of persons, &amp;c. and that no earthly grandure can hinder the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. We see the first Angels preaching is an information, the seconds is an intimation, but this of the third is a fearful commination, which teaches us that Gods sevants come not all, or at all times after one straine, but according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers works and ends whereto they are appointed, they are fitted with diversity of gifts, some to be sonnes of thunder, some of consolation, and some at one time to come with the rod and austerity of the Baptist, and the same at another time to come like a milde <hi>Moses</hi> with the spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this commination, we see what a fearful guiltinesse it is, after that the light of the Gospel has so clearly and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully shined, to follow Antichrist, and to continue obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in error and idolatry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. We see here likewise what dreadful wrath and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hangs over the heads of such.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How they lie not onely under the wrath of God
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170105:114"/> without any mercy here, but likewise what easlesse and endlesse punishment abides them in hells fire hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. Where it is said, that the smoak of their torment ascends; This shews that where the cry of sin unrepented of ascends first, the smoak of the eternal torment who do sin shall ascend next.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is to be noted that this commination is only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the worshippers of the Beast, and those who are his marked ones, but not against such as were but only of his name, or number of his name, which serves to answer them who ask, what became of our predecessors that lived in the time of Popery? surely most of them knew not the deepnesse of Satan, but were onely of the name or number of the name of the Beast, and therefore are charitably to be judged of, as many such no doubt are yet in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> groaning under their spiritual captivity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. Where he sayes, here is the patience of the Saints, we see wherewith they should arme themselves in the time of the enemies prevailing, or of their own pressure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here also we have the mark of true Christians spoken of <hi>v.</hi> 1. and <hi>c.</hi> 7.3. to wit, they keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus without dividing, as hypocrites do (like the false mother) the one from the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 13. <hi>John</hi> is bidden write what this voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven spake, to teach us that we should beleeve as the voice of God and his Spirit for our instruction (against Papist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and Enthusiasts) that which is written.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where it is said, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord; we see that death to the godly is a blessing, and makes them blessed, which to the wicked is a curse, and makes them most wretched.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This manner of speech imports, that a Christian, both in life and death is not to be considered as a single man, living or dying in himself, but in another who is immortal, and to whom by death he is only by a coelestial union more neerly and comfortably joyned.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It follows then, if we would die in the Lord, we must live in the Lord, and not be like <hi>Balaam,</hi> who wished to die the death of the righteous, but not live his life.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Where it is said, That they rest from their labours;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170105:115"/> we see that our life then is but a time of toile and labours, and as <hi>Job</hi> sayes, <hi>c.</hi> 7.2. as a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as a hyrling looketh for the reward of his work, so do the godly by death for their eternal Sabbath, and therefore neither feares it so as others do themselves, nor yet excessively mournes for the death of their dearest.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Where it is said, that their works follow them, we see then that a verbal profession is not sufficient without good works, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Here we see the immortality of the soul, and that when the bodies of the godly are laid in the grave, their souls go to heaven to receive presently rest from their labours and remune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their good works.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This is a lesson to all who delight to be followed here with great trains or backs, (all which notwithstanding at death or in distresse do forsake men,) to provide for themselves after death such a back or following which the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.34. calls the laying up in store for themselves a good foundation for the time to come.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. This following is for remuneration, so that we see that the good works of the godly here, wants not their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heaven; not of debt or merit, as the Apostle distinguishes, <hi>Romans</hi> 4.4, 5. but of grace and mercy, <hi>&amp; ratione pacti non facti;</hi> God so promising, but we not deserving.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The time from henceforth, that is, from the very houre of death, that then instantly their blessedness, rest and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration beginneth, serveth cleerly to convince the errour of Purgatory.</p>

Whereas Christ is said to sit on a white cloud, crowned with gold, we see the farre different estate of our head while he was on earth in low abasement, and crowned with thornes, from that which now he has in heaven, and as it is with the head, so shall it be with his members.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where he has a sickle in his hand to reape, we see that all the wicked are no more to God then a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of grasse or ripe corne to a sharp sickle in a strong hand.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. Here we see by the Lords thrusting in his sickle, and reaping the earth, the Lords ready answering and granting the desires of his own, who wait upon him, and on his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see also his great power, that upon the thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of his sickle, the whole earth presently was reaped.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. By this crying of this Angel to the other that had the sickle to reap, we see that it is the duty of the Lords zealous and faithful servants to excite and stir up one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

As the true Church is called a vine, so are the wicked, but with this addition, a vine of the earth, as cleaving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and only savouring thereof.

                  <p>Here begins the Vision whereby is exprest the sure and happy condition of the godly who had kept themselves free of the fellowship of Antichrist.</p>
                  <p>First then, he sees then a sea of glass, a type of the world as was shewn, <hi>c.</hi> 4. which is said here to be mingled with fire, which signifies trouble and affliction, as we see, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.12. and <hi>Luke</hi> 12.49. shewing thereby, 1. What is the estate of the godly in it, as is told them, <hi>John</hi> 16.33. 2. That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is in it without a mixture thereof, for in heaven only is joy without sorrow, and contentment without change. 3. The great power and providence of the Creator, who keeps things of contrary qualities therein together, as water and fire the one undestroyed by the other.</p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:170105:117"/>
                  <p>Next, He sees them that had gotten the victory over the beast standing thereon, signifying thereby, 1. That now they were come out of their former troubles and had overcome the same. 2. That, as <hi>c.</hi> 12. the woman trod upon the moon, so here on this sea, which represents the godly their tredding upon the world in affection.</p>
                  <p>These also are said to have the harps of God, that is, godly hearts and well tuned to sing praise to him for their forenamed victory, which are called harps of God. 1. For excellency and estimation, according to the Hebrew phrase, as we see <hi>Psal</hi> 80.10. the goodly and tall Cedars, are called the Cedars of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 36.6. 2. Because such hearts are the special gift of God, when he gives us not only cause to praise him, but also hearts to praise him. And, 3. Because such hearts and his praise that comes from them is most acceptable to God.</p>

                  <p>It is also called the song of the Lamb. 1. As Authour and Teacher thereof to them, and therefore it is said, <hi>chap.</hi> 14.3. that none others could learn it, but they only. 2. As the subject of their song, it being the Lamb that was praised thereby.</p>
                  <p>In the tenour of their song they praise the Lord for his works, and for his wayes, to his works they give two Epithets, great and marvellous; To his wayes, other two, just and true when they speak so of his works, they stile him Lord God Almighty, because of his power, when they speak of his wayes, they stile him, King of Saints, because of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                  <p>The works of the Lord which are great and marvellous are, 1. His work of creation, for which they praise him, <hi>c.</hi> 4.11. and wherein his power and wisdom is seen, even in the smallest creature. 2. His work of redemption for which they praise him, <hi>c.</hi> 5, 9. wherein his wisdome, power and love to mankinde is seen, having passed by the fallen Angels. And, 3. The work of his providence and gubernation, preserving his Church, confounding at last his enemies, and making all their actions tend to his glory in the end and his Churches good, wherein therefore is seen his wisdom, power, providence, and justice, for which he is praised, <hi>c.</hi> 19.1. The stile which he gets in respect of these works, is, Lord God Almighty, whereof we spake before, <hi>c.</hi> 4.8.</p>
                  <p>Next they call his wayes just and true, by his wayes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his manner of operation, and specially the secret and unseen steps thereof, wherein he maketh still progresse till he perform what he is at last to manifest, as a man doth who walks on his way, till he be at the end thereof. As may be seen in <hi>Joseph's</hi> advancement, <hi>Israels</hi> deliverance from <hi>Egypt, Hamans</hi> conspiracy, and from <hi>Babylon, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The stile he gets in regard of these is, King of Saints, 1. In respect of his own supereminent holinesse above them all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Saints by creation, as the elect Angels; or by communication of grace and sanctification, as the the godly. 2. In respect of their conformity with him, they being holy as he is holy, and that there is like King, like people. 3. In respect that they worship him, and acknowledge none to be Lord and King over his Church but him, and will not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Beast; nor acknowledge any Papal Monarchie nor sin to lord over them.

                  <p>The fruits of the great and marvellous works of God which arise thereby, and are due by all the godly, as a retribution to him; are, 1. Fear. 2. Glory, and, 3.

                  <p>The reasons whereof are set down. 1. That God onely is holy, by the holinesse of the Creator, which is essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, original, and perfect, and who may justly be called in the abstract, holinesse it self, which no creature should be

                  <p>First then, they are called Angels because of their message and commission, as we see Pastors called, <hi>c.</hi> 1.20. &amp; 14.6, 8. and next for number, they are caled seven. 1.

                  <p>Secondly, they come out of the Temple, to shew thereby, 1. That they come forth by direction from God, having their mission and commission from him who is Lord of the Temple, which is the house of God. 2. That they come out to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute a holy and acceptable work to God, and for his Church. 3. That as Antichrist did sit, that is, rule and reign in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, that is, over Christs Church, professing his name in common as God, that is, pretending to be his Vicar, and usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same power, as the Apostle speaks, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.4. so out of the Temple, (like <hi>Moses</hi> out of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court) those should come that should work his overthrow.</p>

                  <p>Also this cloathing of theirs is girded unto them, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thereby their cheerful alacrity and readinesse to do their work, as we see this phrase in the same sense used, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.8.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, their breasts are girded with a golden girdle, which the Apostle expounds, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.14. to be the girdle of truth, fitly said to be of gold, to shew the preciousnesse thereof, and wherewith their breasts wherein the heart is, are girded, to signifie that it is not head knowledge of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170105:119"/> the truth which they have, but heart knowledge, as also that within their limits of revealed truth, as within a girdle they contain themselves.</p>

                  <p>Here againe we have the furniture of these Angels set down, and from whom they receive the same, before, <hi>v.</hi> 6. The same was called seven plagues, and here it is said, that they had seven golden vials full of the wrath of the eternal God. The vial being a vessel or cup larger above then under, shews (as sayes <hi>Primasius</hi> and with him <hi>Ribera</hi>) that the punishment of Antichrist and his wicked adherents, shall not be hid or secret, but open and manifest to all, as that which is poured out of a cup. Next, these vials are said to be of gold, to shew that these judgements shall proceed from a just God, with whom there is no corruption, nor iniquity in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but who is righteous in all his wayes, and holy in all his works. Thirdly, they are said to be full of Gods wrath, the cause whereof as we see, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. is the fulnesse of the cup of sinne, which when the all-seeing and long-suffering God sees is come to the height, then he fills to the brim the cup of his wrath, and gives the same to the wicked to drink. Lastly, it is called the wrath of God who liveth for ever and ever, thereby to aggravate the same, it not being like the wrath of a mortal man, whose wrath like himself is of short continuance, but which shall be for ever as God is for ever.</p>
                  <p>Next, it is said, that one of the four beasts gave unto them these vials, <hi>&amp; quod de uno dicitur, de omnibus dictum accipitur</hi> (says <hi>Ribera</hi>) to shew unto us that it shall not be by brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick enthusiasmes as it were immediately from God, that those Angels should be furnished with the denunciations of these judgements against Antichrist and his followers, but by the knowledge of the truth and Word of God transmitted faithfully to them by those faithful Pastors and Teachers who had gone before them. As one candle lights another, and wherewith they being furnished, shall go forth with boldnesse and courage, and by zealous preaching shall poure forth as it were the ensuing plagues, as is said, <hi>c.</hi> 16.10. on the seat of the Beast, and upon his Kingdom to the darkning thereof.</p>

                  <p>In the end here is set down by what power this great work shall be effectuate, to wit, even by Gods own glorious presence and power with his Church, which is called here the filling of the Temple with smoak from the glory of God, and from his power, so that none shall be able to impede that work, allusion being here made, to <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.34. and 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.10, 11. Where the cloud filled the Tabernacle and Temple, but here it is said, that the Temple was filled with smoak, shewing thereby unto us, as he shall be in mercy and power for his Church, so that he shall kindle in wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his enemies, and be to them like a consuming fire, before the flames whereof burst forth, smoak goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, it is said, that no man was able to enter into the Temple till the seven plagues of the seven Angels were fulfilled, <hi>Primasius, Ausbertus</hi> and <hi>Haymo,</hi> as <hi>Ribera</hi> reports, make this to be the sense <hi>nominem posse penetrare hoc secretum judiciorum Dei</hi> (say they) <hi>donec finiantur plagae;</hi> But the truest meaning seemes to be this, that none was able to impead these plagues and judgements, or to stay the Lords powerful hand that now was begun to be stretched forth against his Churches enemies, not so much as by entring into the Temple to make deprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them, as we may see the like, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.1. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 1. WHere mention is made of the seven last plagues, we see that the Lord poureth not out all his wrath on the wicked at once, but makes them taste of his sparing mercy expecting their repentance, even when he has begunne in justice to punish.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where it is said, that in them is filled up the wrath of God, we learn what impenitencie and ripeness of impiety at last doth produce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. The sea of glasse which <hi>John</hi> sees mingled with fire, teaches us, that nothing in this world is to be expected by the godly, but fiery tryals, and hot persecutions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the godly shal ever in the end have the victory, as it is said here, that the elect number had the victory over the beast, and over his image and mark, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By their standing upon the sea of glasse, as we see also, <hi>c.</hi> 12.1. We see that the godly tread on the world in affection, by contempt thereof, and on all the troubles they can endure therein, as we see Christ did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Where it is said that they had the harps of God, we see that for all the Lords benefits, the godly have thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hearts to praise him, which is the greatest benefit of all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. Where it is said they sang the song of <hi>Moses,</hi> we see that the godly should be acquainted with Scripture, that for like favours bestowed on Gods people, they may learn the like duties.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The greatest honor or best stile that one can have, or should strive to have, is this, to be called here with <hi>Moses,</hi> the servant of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see here by the mentioning of <hi>Moses</hi> so long, and honourably after his death, that the just shall be had in everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remembrance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Where their song is likewise called the song of the Lamb, because he was the subject thereof, we see wherein our rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and songs of praise in like manner should be, to wit, in Christ Jesus and him crucified.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:170105:121"/>5. The Lords works here are called great and marvellous, wherein because we cannot imitate him. Let us in all humility and reverence admire them, and adore him, and strive that our works may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="5 letters">

                  <p n="6">6. He is called just and true in his wayes, therefore let us be so in ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="7">7. His stile is, 1. Lord God Almighty, which is both a comfort to his own in their greatest straits, as also a terrour to his mightiest enemies.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Next he is called, King of Saints. Let therefore such as be so truely, worship him only, and these who have his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as their King, be Saints really.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. By this interrogation, who shall not fear thee? &amp;c. We see that it is the duty of all to feare, glorifie and worship God only in a religious manner.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He onely is called holy here, essentially and causally, the one in himself, the other towards us, and therefore seeing all holinesse only flows from him, therefore let the same be sought only from him, and the praise thereof given to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where it is said, for thy judgements are made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, let men beware to make their sinnes manifest, as <hi>Sodom,</hi> for then assuredly in Gods own time, Gods judgements against them shall be likewise made manifest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. Gods Church here is called the Temple of God, therefore it and all the true members thereof should be holy, as we see, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.21. also a house of prayer, and not a denne of theeves, wherein sins are nestled, that robs God of his glory and men of their salvation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is called the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, because in the innermost part thereof called so, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony or Law of God was laid up, which teaches us, that we in like manner as <hi>David</hi> sayes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.11. should lay up and hide Gods Word in our hearts, that we may not sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Temple is said now at last to be opened, which shews unto us, that howsoever the true Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. Where the seven Angels come out of the Temple with plagues, we see that Christs Church which is an almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of mercy to the godly, the same is a store-house of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170105:121"/> against the wicked, and the Angels thereof as they have the message of mercy to some, so they have the message of wrath gainst others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where it is said that these Angels are cloathed in pure white linnen, and had golden girdles about their b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>easts, this shews us what godly Ministers of the Gospel should be, as the meaning thereof is set down in the Explication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver</hi> 7. We see that full cups with sin, procures assuredly in the end, full vials of the wrath of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. These vials are golden, which teaches us. that righteous and uncorrupt always is the Lord in all his judgements and wayes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As God is called Almighty, <hi>v.</hi> 3. so he is here called et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. The filling of the Temple with smoak from the glory of God, teaches us that the Lord is ever present with his Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the glory of God is as well seem in his smoaking wrath against the wicked, as in his saving mercy towards the godly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whereas none was able to enter into the Temple till the plagues were fulfilled, we see that it is a fearful case so to despise mercie offered, that at last the Lord becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable.</p>

For the right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which plagues, the fifth and sixth verses may be called a key to open the right meaning thereof, which shews, that as they had shed the blood of Saints and Prophets, so should theirs be shed, and they should get blood to drink, so that we see, 1.

                  <p>Follows here the pouring out of the fourth vial, with the effect that it produceth, both primarily and secondarily. This vial then is said to be poured out upon the Sunne, not that thereby the Sunne it self, or that which is here meant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by was plagued, as in the former vials, those things whereon they were poured out, were plagued, but it being poured out upon the Sunne, (as it is said here) power was given him to scorch and plague others. 1. Then, we have to consider, what is meant here by the Sun. 2. What is meant by his scorching. 3. What they do who are scorched. 1. Positively or by commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And, 2. Negatively or by omission.</p>
                  <p>First then, by the Sun no other thing is meant, then was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, <hi>c.</hi> 9.2. Where it is said, that the Sunne was darkned by the smoak that ascended out of the bottomlesse pit, to wit, the truth of God as it is revealed in his Word, which makes the Sonne of righteousnesse made known to us, and serves as the Sunne to give light to the dark world. This truth of God then by the faithful preaching thereof, after so long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuscation by Popish errours and ignorance, which is a blessing of it selfe, and to all godly beleevers, is said to be a plague here to those that follow Antichrist in their obdured obstinancy And therefore we see,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the effect thereof upon such, is the scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them as it were with fire, not turning, but tormenting them, as is said of the Jewes (<hi>Acts</hi> 7.54) that when they had heard <hi>Steven,</hi> they were cut to the heart, and gnashed their teeth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The thing which these who were so scorched do. 1. Positively, or by sin of commission is, they blaspheme the Name of God, his Name being taken for his Word, as we see, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.15. which the Papists do calling it obscure, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, a nose of wax, &amp;c. and the truth which is professed and consonant thereto, heresie, lies, Lutheranisme and such like.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They repented not to give him glory, that is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse their sinne, as we see the same words in the same sense spoken by <hi>Joshuah</hi> to <hi>Achan,</hi> Josh. 7.19. saying, <hi>My Son give I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Israel, and confesse what thou hast done.

He brought dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse upon the world out of the bottomlesse pit; so here the Lord brings darknesse upon his Kingdom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, not, but that his kingdom before his darknesse was brought upon it, was a kingdome of darknesse, as Satan whose vicar the beast is, is the Prince of darknesse; but that darknesse was the darknesse of ignorance and errour, or <hi>culpae;</hi> and this is the darknesse of heavy calamity, or <hi>poenae. (Significat obscuratam esse illorum prosperitatem &amp; laetitiam, qui Antichristo parebant,</hi> sayes <hi>Ribera</hi>) as we see, <hi>Jer</hi> 13.16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 32.8. and <hi>Joel</hi> 2.2. and the losse of that wonted lustre, respect and reverence that was had thereto, as to the Apostolick sea, and to him that had the keys of the Kingdom of heaven, his Bulls and Pardons, his Indulgences and Excommunications now being no wise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
                  <p>The secondary effect that ensues hereon is twofold, like that of the former vial. 1. Positive, they gnawed their tongues for pain, or grief, as it is said of the wicked Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.54. that at <hi>Stevens</hi> preaching, they gnashed their teeth for anger. Herein also, (as, <hi>v.</hi> 7.) Gods judgments being righteous, for with their tongues by false doctrine they sinned, and as by Scorpion tailes they bred pain to many, (as we see, <hi>c.</hi> 9.10.) therefore now they are said to gnaw their tongues for pain. As likewise it is said, (as we have it before, <hi>v.</hi> 9.) that they blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their

And 6. What are their actions, or how they are chiefly exercised.</p>
                  <p>First then, in a word these who are here described, are the Jesuits of our times, who h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d their beginning, as has been said, shortly after <hi>Luthers</hi> discovery of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>lling away of people and Nations from the professon thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly they are said to come out of the mouth of the dragon, the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st and false prophet, that is, (as sayes <hi>Ribera</hi> a Jesuit himself) <hi>quia,</hi> 1. <hi>Eorum jussu missi sunt,</hi> or as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their mission and commission joyntly from all three, but not from the dragon immediately, but by the beast and false Prophet, that is the Papacy and Pope. 2. They are said to come out of the mouth of the dragon, in respect of inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as being breathed out by him, and inspired with him, for which cause also▪ <hi>v</hi> 14. they are caled the spirits of devils. 3. They are said to come out of the mouth of the dragon, in respect of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, and venting the doctrines of devils and of errour, such
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170105:126"/> as are mentioned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. even as the words of the mouth expresses the meaning of the minde, as also they vent not onely lies, but likewise, as <hi>v.</hi> 14. They suggest the councels of cruelty, and breaths blood-shed, and so in both are like the dragon their father, who was a liar and murtherer from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, their number is said to be three, a <hi>definite</hi> being put for an <hi>indefinite,</hi> and of witnesses three being most aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, two, as <hi>c.</hi> 11.4. being sufficient, this is to shew their number should abound every where. Three likewise they are called, as coming from three orignals, the Dragon, the Beast, and the false Prophet.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they are called spirits, not that they want bodies, but as <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. Carnal men are called only flesh, though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so they have souls, so these are called spirits, though they have bodies. 1. Because of their pretended condition; to wit, that they are spiritual and conversant about such things, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy is called the spirituality. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Because of their agility in action, being n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mble and sedulous like spirits, and like the old <hi>Pharisees</hi> compassing sea and land to make proselytes to themselves, or compasse their worldly or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed purposes. 3. Because of their subtilty, both in speculation and practise.</p>
                  <p>And as they are called spirits, so it is with this double adjection 1. They are called unclean spirits, (a title common with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.) 1. Because they are so in themselves by spiritual whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which is Idolatry, and corporal likewise for the most part, under pretence of si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gle life and chastity. 2. Because of inducing others, and causing them to commit spiritual whoredome, and so being like <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who not onely sinned himself, but also made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin.</p>
                  <p>Next, they are called the spirits of devils. Because, 1. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired and sent out by him, this being their holy calling. 2. Because of their ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ching every where most divelish plots against the true religion. And, 3. Because of their divelish practises likewise m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ny wayes where they may prevaile to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e their cruelty and avarice.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, they are likned to frogs; because, 1. As froggs breed of corruption, so are they the b ood of a corrupt Church and doctrine. 2. The froggs are <hi>amphibia,</hi> so are the Jesuits partly spiritual, as they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll them; partly secular, and meddle more with policy then piety. 3. Frogs are in great number
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170105:126"/> together in their marrish places, so are Jesuits in their Colledges, and in Popish Countreys. 4. They have one sound, which they ever crout and ingeminate, and so has the Jesuits, the Church, the Church, just like the old Jews that cryed, the Temple, the Temple. 5. They are loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est at night when the Sun is gone down, and so are the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites where the light of the Gospel shines not. 6. The light of a cleer torch at such a time makes them silent, and all of them to hide themseves, and so does the cleere light of Gods Word to the Jesuites, where it is powerfully taught. 7. It is also said of the froggs, that the frogges who were the plague of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they haunted not only the Court and Countrey, but also all ovens and kneading troughs, <hi>Exod</hi> 8.3. even so the Jesuites they haunt all places and persons where they may procure riches and gaine to their Order; and lastly, sayes one merrily, <hi>ranarum quadrata capita geometricis eorum pileis apte respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, their actions are, 1. Working miracles, which is subjoyned to the title they get, of spirits of devils, to shew that such as they pretend to be wrought by them for confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their idolatrous religion, are not true or divine miracles, but as has been said on <hi>c.</hi> 13.13. they are wraught by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the devil, and are either lying or inducing to lies, and so deceitful alwayes.</p>
                  <p>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>xt, it is said that they go forth as Satan and Antichrists emissaries to the Kings of the earth, that is, who are onely earthly minded, and are those spoken of, <hi>c.</hi> 18.9. who shall bide by the whore to her last cast, the end of whose going to such farre and neer, signified by the whole world, to wit, that is Christian; shall be to gather them to battle, for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding their religion so by blood and cruelty, which ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering is not to be understood local in one place, but as we say material, when they are involved in one cause, and set upon one course to maintain Popery.</p>
                  <p>Next, the day to which they are said to gather them to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, is caled the great Day of God Almighty, thereby to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, 1. That it is not earthly men that these earthly Kings oppose, but it is God Almighty, and his cause against whom they set themselves. 2. That in that day against these migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enemies of his Church, He who is more Mighty, even God Almighty, shall manifest his power and great strength. 3. This
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170105:127"/> day is called his day, not theirs, to shew the successe, that he shall be victorious thereon, as we commonly call the day theirs, who are the victors.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. In this first plague poured on the earth by the first An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel and in sundry subsequent, allusion is to the plagues of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> which teaches us, that it is necessary that for understanding of Scripture and Gods dealings therein, we be acquainted with Scripture.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 3, 4. The pouring out of these vials not all at once, but one after another, teaches us Gods long suffering patience to the most wicked, expecting their repentance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.20. and as we see in <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The retribution of blood for blood, as we see in this plague, and the reason thereof, <hi>v</hi> 6. shews as is acknowledged, <hi>v.</hi> 5. and 7. how righteous are the Lords judgements, <hi>Judg.</hi> 1.7.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. By the Angels praising God for his righteous judging, we see that it is our duty in like manner so to do, not rejoycing that men are plagued or destroyed, but that God gets glory, and his justice is seen on wickednesse, and that his Church gets deliverance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The eternity that is here ascribed to God, shews us, that no wickednesse in no age can escape unpunished, as long as he lives who is everlasting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. Where it is said, that they shed the blood of the Saints and Prophets, we see how farre the Lord suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the wicked sometime to prevaile against his dearest chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. Where it is said here, for they are worthy, we see it to be true that distinction which the Apostle makes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. that the wicked merit their punishment, but not so the godly life everlasting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. In this antiphony of the other Angel conforme to the first, we see what happy harmony should be among the godly, specially in the work of Gods worship, like the unity, <hi>Act</hi> 4.32. without contrariety, like that contradiction of <hi>Korah, Numb.</hi> 16.11. or confusion, as was at the building of <hi>Babel,</hi> but like that which was at the builing of the Temple, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Gods eternity before, <hi>v.</hi> 5. and his omnipotency here, are two strong props of comfort, like <hi>Solomons</hi> two brasen pillars to the godly, but grounds of terrour to the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. As the Angel here joynes truth and righteousnesse in God, so let us therein imitate him to be true in our speeches, and righteous in our actions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. We see here that the Sunne, which by the heat and light thereof is a blessing, is here a plague to the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170105:130"/> wicked, so that the Lord turnes their blessings into curses, as he turns that which by nature is a curse to blessings to the godly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see that the preaching of the Gospel of truth, represented here by the Sun, whereof others get good, they get nothing thereof but evil, to wit scorching, that is, torment of an evil conscience, hardning, as clay is by great heat, and stirring up to rage.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where Gods Word is here compared to the Sunne, we see that of it self it is not obscure, but to those whose eyes are blinded by prejudice and misbelief, or as the Apostle sayes unto them who perish.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Sun which now shines here and scorches Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans was before darkned, <hi>c.</hi> 9. but is not so any more, which shews us, that although errour and ignora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ce prevail for a while, yet at last truth shall have the victory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. These who are scorched do blaspheme Gods Name, which teaches us the difference between the wicked and the godly, and how the same is best seen in trouble, the godly ever blesse God, as <hi>Job</hi> did; but the wicked rage impatiently and blaspheme, as <hi>Iobs</hi> wife wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>led him to do, and as these do here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is said, that God had power over these plagues, which teaches us when any plague is upon a land, or persons, to whom they should go to be delivered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see that plagues or punishments are inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any to bring them to repentance, as we see <hi>Hosea</hi> 5.15. but the wicked make no such, but a wrong use thereof, as it is said here, that they blasphemed, but repented not.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Where it is said, to give him glory, we see that by true repentance God gets the glory, and we the good, and who glorifies him so here, shall be glorified with him hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. As we see in the plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> so we see here, that the Lord begins farther off at first, to wit, at the earth, waters, and Sun, before he come neerer to the Throne or seat of the beast▪ which should teach men before God come neer them with his plagues or punishments, to draw neer to God by true and timely repentance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The wonted glory and lustre that the Beasts Kingdom
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170105:130"/> had by ignorance, errour and idolatry, is now turned to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which teaches us, that all seeming good, profit, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or advancement, &amp;c. which is got by sin at last ends in the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As nothing could hinder the darknesse of <hi>Egypt</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto allusion is made, so nothing could hinder this, which teaches us, that when God is to punish, none are able to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pead his judgments.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is said here, that they gnawed their tongues for paine, where we see that as the Lord makes the guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the wicked to be their own accuser and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, so he makes them likewise to be his own tormenter and burden.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see here again the Lords sutable judgements to the sinne, they seduced and sinned by their tongue, therefore here they are punished in their tongue, wherefore beware in what manner, or by what member we sin, lest by the same we be likewise punished.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. By drying up of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> we see that there is no earthly fortification, or other thing whatsoever to be trusted unto, especially when God comes against any.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where this is done, that the way of the Kings of the East may be prepared, we are taught hereby, that when God has a work to perform, he can make way for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, as we see ln <hi>Josephs</hi> preferment, <hi>Mordecai's</hi> advancement, his peoples safety, <hi>Hamans</hi> overthrow, and such like, therefore let none question, as <hi>Luke</hi> 1.34. <hi>How shall this be?</hi> for as is said there, <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>with God nothing is impossible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hereby also we see, the hope that is, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of these open enemies of the Christian name at last.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 13, 14. By the coming of these uncleane spirits out of the mouth of the dragon, beast and false prophet, we see what and from whence the calling and vocation of that Jesuitical late sect of our times is, and whose emissaries these are.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the time of their arising, to wit, upon the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the waters of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> expounded, <hi>c.</hi> 17.15. and upon the nature of their imployment, <hi>verse</hi> 14. here we see, according as is told us, <hi>verse</hi> 17. That the fall of mystical <hi>Babylon, Rome</hi> is at hand, and that they
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170105:131"/> are the last prevalent Sect that shall arise before the same.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In respect that they come out of the mouths of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named three, it is no marvel that they breath blood and lies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Proceeding from all three joyntly, we see of what nature is Popish unity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Being called spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="6">6. Being also spirits of devils, who are so called, from their knowledge, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, we see what Jesuitical subtilties and learning is, whereby they have sophisticated all true divinity, to wit, nothing else, but that which they have common with the devil, and are thereby not <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="7">7. Working of miracles is ascribed to them, whereby we see what advantage Romanists make for their cause by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the working of miracles, which the Spirit of God here, and 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.9. maketh to be in the last times a badge of Antichrist and his frogs.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 The sedulity in evil which is subjoyned, should teach true Pastours to be more diligent for the work of God, and in good.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Their excitation to battel and blood where ever they come, and gets the eare of great men should teach all Kingdoms and Common-wealths, what may be expected where they are, and the more to be aware of them.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Without these we see what our spiritual estate is, to wit, a shameful nakednesse to be seen of Saints and Angels, and which shall disable us to stand before God in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see that Satans aime by temptation and trouble is to bereave us of these, and therefore we are exhorted the more carefully to keep them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. Where it is said, that he, that is, Satan gathered them, who, <hi>v.</hi> 14. are said to be gathered by his Jesuitical a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents. As also that he and they gathered them to the like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, as at <hi>Megiddo, Jabin</hi> and <hi>Sisera</hi> had, that is, to their own
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170105:131"/> destruction. Let Popish Princes take heed to this, and beware of such Jesuitical instigations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see that an evil cause shall ever have an ill successe in the end, as we see <hi>Judg.</hi> 20. and here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Seeing the successe of this gathering has its name from the like event before at <hi>Megiddo,</hi> then from Gods power and works of old for his Church, or confidence for like future suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse ought to be confirmed.</p>

The seventh vial is poured out in the aire, whereof Satan is called the prince, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. as thereby having the advantage above us, whereby we see wherein Satan or his instruments place their greatest advantage against the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God even in that shall disappoint him and them, yea oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times plague them therein.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where it is said, that there came a voice out of the Temple, and from the Throne, we see where the Lords Throne is seated of his gracious government, to wit, in his Church and true members thereof. As also, that his judgements are all holy and righteous.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where it is said, in the preterit, It is done, which in the future was onely to be done, this teaches us, that Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of judgements, except men repent, are as sure as if they were already executed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. These voices (as they are expounded) shews that lamentation shall be to the wicked when rejoycing shall be to the godly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. These thunders and lightnings, shew, that as fiery and slatulent exhalations that ascend and ripen in the clouds, by agitation seeking a vent, at last breaks out with a terrible noise and lightning, and causes a sudden storme, so does the sins of the wicked that ascend to heaven after the Lords long suffering patience brake forth at last into a terrible storm of the wrath of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As there is thunder and lightning from heaven, so there is an earthquake below, which teaches us, that when God is angry against the wicked, heaven and earth are ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire to punish them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This concussion of the earth shews, that there is no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or worldly estate so stable, but when God is angry may easily be shaken, and that they that confide therein, are but like foolish builders upon the sand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 19. Where it is said, that the great City was divided, we
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170105:132"/> see that no worldly grandure is priviledged or able to save.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Division also goes before destruction, <hi>c.</hi> 18.2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where the lesser Cities of the Nations are said to have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len likewise, it teaches us, that the seduced as well as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer shall be punished, and the blind that are led by the blinde shall both fall into the ditch.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is said that great <hi>Babylon</hi> came in remembrance before God, which teaches us, that God is not oblivious of mens sins, nor his Churches wrongs, but will punish the one, and redress the other in his own time.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is said to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his wrath, which shews us how the Lord proportions his punishments suitable to mens sinnes, giving cup for cup, as we see, <hi>c.</hi> 17.4.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see here likewise, what abused long suffering doth at last produce, to wit, not only wrath, but fiercenesse of wrath.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We see that Gods punishments of the wicked are in wrath, without mixture, as <hi>c.</hi> 14.10. whereas the corrections of his children are ever in love and mixed with mercy.</p>

That to know this Mystery a retired and holy disposition of a contemplative minde is required. 2. The woman representing the true Church, <hi>c.</hi> 12.14. was left in a wildernesse. But here in place of her <hi>Iohn</hi> findes indeed a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but another sort of woman, a whore, so that here is the <hi>Roman</hi> local succession whereof they brag, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.21. a

                  <p>First then, <hi>Ribera</hi> the Jesuite tells, (<hi>Rib.</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 1.) that this woman is <hi>Rome,</hi> saying, this woman signifies <hi>Rome,</hi> who had allured many to her idolatry, and was to allure many by hope of gain, both of goods and pleasures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this beast is the Papacy or Papal clamed autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that bears up idolatrous <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church thereof in its grandure and glory. Which is said, 1. To be scarlet coloured, which being taken literally may denotate that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour wherewith her Cardinals and Conclave are clad, but Mystically signifies, as <hi>v.</hi> 6. her bloody disposition. 2. The same is said to be full of the names of blaspemy, whereby blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous doctrines as also titles are meant, whereof we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready spoken, <hi>c.</hi> 13.5, 6. such is papal divinity. 3.

                  <p>Only there rests here one great doubt or difficulty in
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170105:139"/> the words that follow, how in such an evil action, as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and give their Kingdom to the beast, God can be said to put that in their heart, or they therein to do Gods Will, as we have the like speeches, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Psalme</hi> 105.25. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.9. and <hi>Acts</hi> 4.27. by which and the like speeches the evil works of men are ascribed to God. But this is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly or absolutely to be understood, as if God were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of such (which were blasphemy) but in so far as by them the Lord is the executer of his just judgement, punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sin by sinne, as we see, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.10, 11. and making that which is <hi>malum culpae</hi> upon mans part to be <hi>malum paenae</hi> upon his part, man being unjust in the one, but God ever just and righteous in the other.</p>
                  <p>In all which things we have likewise to consider, 1. The natural motion in every sinful action which is from God, in whom we are and move. 2. The vitiosity of the action, like claudication, which is from mans corruption and Satans instigation. 3. The diversity of the ends, Gods end being ever good, though mans be sinful, as in <hi>Josephs</hi> selling, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.7. and Christs crucifying, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.27. And, 4.

Let us heare their own <hi>Clemangi,</hi> saying, <hi>quid de tua prophetia, Johannis scilicet in Apocalipsi censes?

But <hi>Rome</hi> under the Papacy is such, therefore is the seat of Antichrist.

                  <p>But the Pope sits in the seat of Antichrist as such,</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 1. By this new vision, and the Angels talking with him shewing him the meaning thereof, we see that the Lord still increases the knowledge of his own who are desirous thereof in his heavenly mysteries, so that it
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170105:140"/> grows like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> waters, or as from the dawning to the cleer day, till it be perfected in glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the title of whoredome it gets, we see how hateful idolatry is, and how highly it provokes Gods wrath, who is a jealous God, as the whoredome of a woman who playes the common harlot provokes the jealousie of her husband.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where the Angel sayes, I will shew thee the judgment of the great whore, we see that idolatry and idolaters in Gods time shall never escape judgement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. By naming Kings of the earth first, and then the other inhabiters thereof, who had committed fornication with the whore, we see that the examples of the greatest in evil is most pernitious, as on the contrary their good example proves unto good most powerful.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Seeing idolatry is likened here to wine, as sensual and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, no marvel then that people be more prone thereto then to truth and Gods pure worship.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Seeing here also we see how it inebriates, no marvel then though we see those that are drunk therewith so obstinate and incorrigible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> sees this woman in a wildernesse, we see then that this world is but a wildernesse, barren in any good, and full of wilde beasts, though therein (as this woman here) any had never so much pomp and pleasure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This beast whereon the woman sits, shews that sin trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes persons or states into brutish beasts, yea, into brutish monsters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. This like glorious external pomp of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in her Pope, Prelates, and pompatical Worship shewes her to be the whore here described, painted and pointed out.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Her cup is said to be full of abominations, teaching us how to esteem truely of her doctrines, and idolatrous worship as most abominable and odious.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Her cup likewise is said to be full of the filthinesse of her fornication, then let P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. Where her name is, Mystery, this teaches us, that Antichrists opposition and working is hid and mysterious, and has been so from its beginings, therefore more to have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in the seeds, while the tares were sowing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. She is called also <hi>Babylon,</hi> when alike sins, we see, makes persons and places to have like names.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By this title likewise of mother of harlots, we see what a mother Church the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Iohn</hi> sees this woman drunk with the blood of the Saints, which shews the blood-thirstinesse of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and her insatiablenesse therein even unto drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Johns</hi> wondring thereat, shews that her cruelty is so great, that it is even to the admiration of all others who are not of her society, and like disposition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. The Angels former invitation of <hi>John</hi> and offer of instruction, <hi>v.</hi> 1. and his readinesse here again to resolve <hi>John</hi> of that whereat he wondred, is a good example of all who have knowledge of heavenly Mysteries to be at all fit occasions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative thereof to others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. Where it is said that the beast should ascend out of the bottomlesse pit, we see the original of that Antichristian <hi>Roman</hi> hierarchie, to wit, that it is not from heaven, but from the bottomlesse pit, whose keys the Angel thereof has, and not <hi>Peters,</hi> or those of the Kingdom of heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is said that this beast goes to perdition, where we may see then whither they go who follow the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and what is the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r doom.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What else is to be noted of that general wondring of the earthly sort, and following after the beast, as also of the excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such whose names are written in the book of life, let the reader see in the notes on <hi>c.</hi> 13.3. and 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. We see here, seeing divine wisdom is requisite to understand sublime and heavenly Mysteries, therefore that those who would know such to their eternal salvation, should earnestly beg the same from God the only giver thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The forme of speech used here, calling the seve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170105:141"/> the bread in the Sacrament of the Lords Table to be taken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, which are spoken (as of the cup also) figuratively.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. The change of the formes of government, and their fall mentioned here, in Nations or republicks, teaches us the mutability of all earthly things, therefore to be despised.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where it is said of the seventh head, that when he comes he must continue but a short space, this shews us, that all future things are known to God, as if they were present, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. Where the beast is the eighth head in respect of a several government different from the former, to wit, spiritual, and is also called one of the seven in respect of his civil and temporal jurisdiction agreeing with the former, this serves cleerly to shew what the Popes claime and usurpation of both swords proves him to be, as <hi>Mantuan</hi> sayes of him.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Ense potens gemino, cujus vestigia adorant</l>
                     <l>Caesar &amp; aurato vestiti murice reges.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. The time likewise of the conjunct rising from temporal sovereignty of the Pope, and the Kings of <hi>Europe</hi> by the fall of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, serves also to shew and prove, that the Papal, is that Antichristian Monarchie, and that the Pope himself is that foretold of Antichrist, it being as sure that Antichrist is come, and that it is he, as it is sure that these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are Kings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see the basenesse of Popish Princes, by being the Popes secular arme to execute his bloody designes, by their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts and armes, to wit, that they are but the horns of such a monstrous and bloody beast.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 13. Where it is said that they have one minde, we see that as there is a godly unity amongst the faithful, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.32. so there is a wicked conspiracy amongst the wicked, <hi>Ps.</hi> 2.1, 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. These Kings they gave their power to the beast, where we see the abuse of authority contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3, 4. for whereas their power is from God, and therefore should be for him, and for the good, they abuse it against him and for the evil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. We see against whom Kings war and are enemies, when they war and persecute poor Protestants, it is not men, but the Lamb Christ Jesus.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where it is said, that the Lamb should overcome them, we see the Almighty power of Jesus Christ over his mightiest enemies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 This shews us likewise the Lords wonderful mercy, overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170105:141"/> his greatest enemies by a merciful conversion, as he did <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and not as they deserved by a just eversion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Those th t were overcome by conversion, were the same with others that gave their power likewise to the beast, and were not converted, mentioned, <hi>c.</hi> 18.1. and 19 19. so that we see before grace come and effectual calling all are alike by nature and sinful disposition or guiltinesse.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the conversion of these beyond others; we see the power of the truth towards the Elect.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see here an admirable victory, and unlikely in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew, a weak Lamb to overcome mighty Kings, but the reason is subjoyned, that he is also by Divine power, a strong Lord, and King of kings, which sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ws unto us that in Gods greatest works which he works by weakest means▪ we should not look to the weaknesse of the means▪ but to his Divine and Almighty power which secretly and unseen concurreth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Seeing he is King of kings, then let all Kings acknowledge themselves his vassals, cast down their crowns at his feet (as we see, <hi>Rev,</hi> 4.10.) sway their Scepters for him, enlarge his Kingdome within thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, and use their royal power to advance his royal dignity, thus shall he honour them who honours him, and establish their thrones to them and their posterity.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We see that the Elect and faithful with him partake of his victory, which teaches us, that if we suffer with him here, and fight for him as we should, contending for the truth, we shall also be victorious with him, and triumph in glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. Where the Angel expounds the waters whereon the whore sits to be peoples, and multitudes, &amp;c. we see of what Church, multitude is a note.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How more prone the multitude is to walk in the broad way of errour and impiety then in the narrow way of truth and godlinesse that leads unto salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. Where it is said, that the hornes before loved the whore, and even the beasts hornes which supported her, shall here in the end hate the whores we see what a strange change the work of conversion and effectual calling makes, where it comes, Lions shall turn Lambs, persecuters preachers, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers turn haters of what rhey loved before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where it is said, that they shall also make her desolate and naked, and eat her flesh, and burn her with fire, this shews us, that the destruction of that <hi>Roman</hi> Antichrist, and his
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170105:142"/> hierarchie once begun, shall hold on constantly by degrees till his final destruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. It is said, that God put this in their heart to do his will, which teaches us that all true conversion begins at the heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there are no good purposes or thoughts that enters into the heart of man, till the Lord put them in, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where God puts grace in the heart, it will kyth in the action by doing of Gods will.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the whore of <hi>Rome</hi> be hated and made desolate, &amp;c. we see that it is acceptable service to God, and the doing of his Will, to which all Christian Princes should consecrate their hearts and hands, and contribute their power and strength, which to omit, is the omitting to do his Will, and to oppose the same, is to oppose his will, which in the end will turn, as we see, <hi>c.</hi> 19.18. to their own destruction.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is said likewise, that it was his Wil that they should agree and give the Kingdom to the beast, which teaches us, that God so over-rules the actions of the most wicked, as when they are doing their Will, that contrary to their intentions, in and by them the Lord is likewise doing his good Will.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is said, till the words of God be fulfilled, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that then Gods Words shall be fulfilled in spite of Satan and all his instruments, yea, that they are fulfilling Gods Words themselves, when they are going on in their most wicked cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, although with no such intention. Let the godly then have patience, and the wicked be assured of Gods threatned judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. Lastly, this woman so to be utterly destroyed, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be <hi>Rome,</hi> that great City which did reign over the Kings of the earth, where we see then the doom of the Papal sea, and that no grandure (whereof she brags, <hi>c.</hi> 18.7.) shall exeem or save her, or any from the revenging hand of Gods just punishment.</p>

Because of her spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual uncleannesse which is idolatry. 2. Because also of her corporal uncleannesse both in head and members, Cardinals, Palaces, Cloisters and Nunries, (See <hi>Platina in vita,</hi> John 12. <hi>&amp; Omphrius in vita Sorgii.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c. also Joannae foeminae, &amp; Alex.</hi> 6.) whereof thus says their own <hi>Mantuan,</hi>

                  <p>He proceeds here in aggrivating her guiltinesse, as the just cause of Gods plagues upon her, by naming three points thereof. 1. Pride or vain glory. 2. Voluptuousnesse of life.

By their lofty and proud claimes, any one may see. 2. By the Popes proud carriage, as that Kings must kisse his feet, the Emperour is to carry his traine the day of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, hold his stirrop, lead his bridle, and bring in his first measse of meat, else in his absence the greatest Prince that is present, as we have it set down in the first book of sacred Ceremonies, <hi>f.</hi> 26. 35. and 41.</p>
                  <p>Next, for he delicious living in all sort of voluptie, this is also more then palpable to any who will look on the Popes Court, the Cardinals pallaces, their Episcopal-seas, stately Abbies, and other sumptuous buildings, so pleasantly situate and plentifully furnished, whose retribution in respect of the former is set down to be this, that how much she hath glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified her self and lived deliciously so much sorrow and torment shall be given her. The evidence likewise of whose gloriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of her sinful security is set down in these words, for she saith in her heart, I sit a Queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow, and this she saith not by word, but in her heart <hi>ne superba videatur</hi> (sayes <hi>Ribera</hi>) noting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by her hypocrisie, and covering her pride under shew of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</p>

That as this great milstone, so this great City should be found no more, or as <hi>Jeremys</hi> words are, she should so sink, that she should never any more rise from the evil that God should bring upon her; where we see, 1. That her destruction shall be violent, such as is used against ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactours, because she used violence against Gods servants. 2. It shall be a down throwing destruction, 1. Because she threw down Gods true Worship, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did Gods Altar, and in place thereof erected her idolatry. 2. Because she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted her self so, as we see, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.4. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7. And thirdly, it shall be an irrecoverable and utter destruction, as the sinking of a milstone in the sea, because she was a sink of all sort of sinne, like <hi>Sodom</hi> in the day of her prosperity, which made her own <hi>Mantuan</hi> call her, <hi>collunies scelerum,</hi> and her famous <hi>Petrarch</hi> to say, <hi>quicquid denique impieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis &amp; morum pessimorum sparsim habet, aut habuit orbis terrae, totum istic cumulatim videas, à cervatimque reperias.</hi> Whereunto may be added, 1.

As this milstone could make no resistance, so neither shall <hi>Rome</hi> be able in that day of the Lords wrath. And, 3. As the throwing down of a thing with violence shews his indignation at the same, who is the down-caster, so shall <hi>Romes</hi> destruction shew Gods fierce indignation that he has at her in the day of his visitation.</p>

Nor what belong'd to profit or commodity, as craftsmen or the like. 3. Nor what belonged to food or necessitie, as grinding any grain, or noise of a milstone. Nor, 4. <hi>v.</hi> 23.

Here also we have in answer to that Popish question, Where was your Church before <hi>Luther?</hi> to which I reply, in the midst of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and bosom of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, even as the seven thousand in <hi>Israel</hi> were in the bosome of the idolatrous Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the Reigne of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see here likewise the condition of the Church militant, like chaff and corn together till the day of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see the danger of evil company, ready to draw the godly to participate with them in their sins, and we too prone to be drawn by them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Participation in sin will make participation in judgement.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. By the reaching of her sinnes up to heaven, we see that sins, though they be transient actions, yet they have a permanent pleading before the Lords tribunal to bring down judgements.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see the Lords long suffering, who presently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the acting of sinne inflicts not punishment, till impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency joyned with impiety cry for the same.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where it is also said, that the Lord remembred her iniquities, we see that the Lord at last will punish, and not seeme to be ever forgetful, and that those who will not remember his Commandments to obey him therein, nor their sins to repent, he will remember towards them his sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est judgements.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 6 We see <hi>Romes</hi> ruine recommended to all Gods people, therefore for this end let Pastours preach, people pray, and Princes performe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see it is not enough to come out of <hi>Babylon</hi> and leave her sinnes, but also to do that to her which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands for her sinnes, as we are commanded to cease to do evil, and learn to do well.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the retribution commanded, we see what bloody perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuters may in the end expect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. We see that their end who seeks only their own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, neglecting Gods, and to live in sinful pleasures, shall be at last in torment and sorrow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By her saying, she sits as Queen and shall see no sorrow, we see the security of the wicked, till unawares Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments come upon them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. She sayes this in her heart (sayes the Lord) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we see the Lord sees, and heares the heart as well as the mouth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see that the most wicked Atheists in heart, will eschew open Atheisme by profession thereof with their mouth, except od <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> who said, <hi>Who is God that I should obey him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. Gods judgements long delayed, come oft-times on the wicked suddenly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Multiplying of sins, procures multiplying of plagues, as we see here, death, famine and burning</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see here that <hi>Romes</hi> last destruction shall be by fire, and like <hi>Sodom</hi> a combustion in ashes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Here is a bulwark against all disfidence, that it shall

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 9, 10. In the lamenting of those Kings that lived deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously with her, we see wherein ends the pleasures and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the wicked.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When God begins to punish in wrath, the strongest arme of flesh cannot avail.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see that Gods judgements will terrifie the stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est hearts whatsoever, therefore they stand far off, for the fear of her torment.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. How fast soever the mightiest be linked in wickednesse or evil courses, yet Gods wrath and judgements shall dissipate them far asunder.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Where they acknowledge that now at last in one houre her judgement is come, we see that the most incredulous and wicked shall in the end acknowledge the truth of the Lords threatnings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. and 13. We see, 1. What the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. The disposition of the wicked is like to these Merchants, who weep not for their sinnes, but for their worldly crosse, because no man buys their merchandize any more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. Where it is said, that in one houre so great riches is come to nought, we see what the greatest riches are to trust to.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All these hear named now stand afar off, which teaches us how fruitlesse and helplesse is the wicked their friendship one to another in the day of the Lords visitation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. Where they say in their lamention, what City is like to this great city.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We see that wicked worldlings still look at worldly gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure deploring the decay of that, but looks not to the true cause thereof, and to Gods justice to magnifie the same.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In one houre being made desolate, it shews, that when God comes he speedily executes.</p>

Where the heaven and holy Saints therein are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted now to rejoyce over her, we see the vicissitude of the godlies and wickeds rejoycing and mourning, the one mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here and shall rejoyce for ever, and the other rejoyced here, as <hi>c.</hi> 11.10, and shall mourn for ever.</p>

                     <pb n="284" facs="tcp:170105:151"/>2. Where it is said that God avenged them on her; we see that God is the avenger of the wrongs of his own, when they cannot, nor through Gods prohibition may not, therefore remit to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This also should let the wicked see, when they wrong the meanest of the goldly, what a great party they make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst themselves.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>v.</hi> 22. We see that the abuse of Gods good benefits, makes the Lord to withdraw them from any.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see also that the Lord makes the very places where sins have been acted to carry the stamp of his deep displeasure.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>v.</hi> 23. Where it is said, for thy Merchants were the great men of the earth, it teaches us that greatnesse attained to by wickednesse, draws on destruction.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Also, where it is added, that by her sorceries likewise were all Nations deceived, this shews the efficacy of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian delusion, and that multitude can be no true note of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>v.</hi> 24. It is said, that in her was found the blood of all that were slaine on the earth, which teaches us, that being accessory to any sinne, as well as acting thereof, makes guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before God.</p>

                  <p>First then, <hi>John</hi> heard a threefold thanksgiving, 1. From much people in heaven. 2. From the twenty four Elders and four beasts, <hi>v.</hi> 4. And, 3.

                  <p>Next they begin their song with a Hebrew word, used by <hi>David</hi> in many of his <hi>Psalmes,</hi> which is a word of exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170105:152"/> of themselves and others to praise the Lord, and is as much by interpretation as, <hi>Laud ye the Lord.</hi> The tenor of their song is, 1. The same with that of the Saints, <hi>c.</hi> 7.10, 12. whereof we have already spoken, ascribing salvation and the glory thereof, as also all religious honour or worship, and all power or omnipotency unto God allanerly, which words therefore are not <hi>optantium sed agnoscentium,</hi> and where also it is to be noted that the <hi>Romish</hi> vulgar translation has on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly these three, <hi>laus &amp; gloria &amp; virtus,</hi> but omits, <hi>honor domino nostro,</hi> and so incurs that curse, <hi>c.</hi> 22.19.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. The matter of their rejoycing is not worldly causes, but heavenly and spiritual, to wit, the Lambs marriage, which should teach us in like manner what should be the matter of our greatest joy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In particular, whereas the Lambs marriage is the cause, this should teach us, that if ever we would have true joy here, or fulnesse of joy hereafter, labour to have our souls es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poused to Christ by a spiritual conjunction, and union by faith
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170105:161"/> here, that so we may be made partakers of that heavenly union which is by sight hereafter.</p>

                  <p>First then, the Judge is described from his seat of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, called a great white throne, alluding to that of <hi>Solomons,</hi> he being the true <hi>Solomon,</hi> and a greater than he, who was said before, <hi>c.</hi> 19. to ride on a white horse, and <hi>c.</hi> 14. on a white cloud, which throne of Majesty is to shew that he is not only a Judge but King, called <hi>c.</hi> 19.16. the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</p>

Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, this Throne is called a great Throne, because set up for a great person, and for a great errand, to wit, the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole world. Next, his dreadful Majesty and glorious power is expressed to be so great, that neither heaven nor earth are able to abide his presence, and much lesse his enemies, therefore they are said to flee away, that there was no place found for them, which <hi>Augustine</hi> expounds well, (<hi>l.</hi> 20. <hi>de civit Dei, c.</hi> 14) saying, that this is, <hi>muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione non interitu,</hi> following that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. where he sayes, that the fashion of this world passes away, which made <hi>John</hi> to say, <hi>c.</hi> 21.1. tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>First then, for their condition, they are called the dead, not that they were so then, but were so before Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to judgement, either by ordinary and natural death, or violent, or by that sudden change which shall be made in place of death immediately before the last judgement, and whether they have died on Sea or Land, therefore it is said; <hi>v.</hi> 13. that the Sea gave up her dead that were in it, and as the Earth and Sea gave up the bodies, so it is said concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the souls of the wicked, that death and hell delivered up the dead that were in them, that so, soul and body being reunited, as they were fellow associates in sinning, so they should be in suffering.</p>
                  <p>Next, they are described from their quality, great and small, to shew, 1. The generality of the Judgement. 2. The impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality thereof.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, their posture is set downe, of standing, to shew the authority of the Judge, called here God, who elsewhere is called the Sonne of man, who is Judge of all (sayes the Apostle, <hi>Rom</hi> 14.10.) and before whose judgement seat all must stand, (sayes he) from the greatest Monarch before whom others stood, to the poorest beggar, every one to give acccount of those things done by them in the flesh.</p>
                  <p>Follows then the manner of the procedure, after the form

The book of the Gospel shall be opened, and men judged thereby for their infidelity, therefore sayes the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my Gospel. 3. The book of mens own consciences shall be opened in that day, which is that inward register which every one carrieth about within his own breast, also another book was opened (sayes <hi>John</hi>) which is the book of life, wherein are registred the names of all Gods Elect, preordained by Gods decree unto life eternal before the foundation of the world. Of all those books it is said, that they shall be opened, that is, made manifest, who kept Gods Law, who walked worthy of the Gospel, who kept a good conscience, and who were written in the book of life, or no, and every one shall be judged according to his work, so that in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, works are so to be looked on, as collation alwayes must be of the books, and relation to the book of life, and as for the works of the godly, <hi>Gregory</hi> observeth well this form of speech, saying, It is one thing to be judged, <hi>secundum opera,</hi> as the evidence of their faith, and <hi>propter opera</hi> as any cause meriting eternal life.</p>

Where it is said, that Satan was shut up, that he should deceive the Nations no more, we see that his task from the beginning hath been deceiving, using fraud where he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevail by force, wherefore we should beware of his decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in his subtle instruments, and acknowledge whose brood they are.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where it is said, that he was bound up so long that he should deceive no more, this shews that on the contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we see seducers arise and to abound, that then Satan in his instruments for the punishment of a Nation or Church, is let loose to be a lying spirit in the mouth of false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>

This shews, us their spiritual condition however they seeme to live, and as the grave or pit of darknesse and the worme attends the dead, so hell and torment at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends such.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. It is said, that over such the second death shall have no power, therefore we see, that the truly godly only may be sure of their salvation, and that they are past from death to life, and the only sure ground of such assurance to be saved, is not a solitary faith, which is but presumption, but true faith which kythes in holinesse of life, and rising from sin daily more and more to righteousnesse, and practice of all holy duties.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Here also we see on the contrary the woful estate of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:170105:171"/> the wicked, over whom the second death shall have power, so that they are subject to three fearful deaths, 1. Death in sin. spiritual. 2. Death for sin with the sting, corporal. And, 3. This second death which is of soul and body in hells fire, eternal.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Where it is not only said, that over the godly the second death shall have no power, but likewise that they shall be Priests of God and Christ, and reign with him a thousand years, we see the two parts of the Saints blessednesse after this life, to wit, liberation from that which is evil, and advancement to all good, happinesse, honour and glory.</p>

We see his rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse malice against mankinde, and chiefly against the Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see what evil use (after so long imprisonment) he makes of his liberty, or the favour that is shewn unto him, and even such is the disposition of the wicked, as we see in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when they are freed from any plague or punishment, returning like the dog to the vomit, and abusing the benefits which God bestows upon them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see that for a like cruel disposition, like enemies gets like names, as here the last enemies of the Christian Church are named by <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> which were the last enemies of the Jewish Church before Christs first coming, to wit, <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> and the <hi>Syrian</hi> Kings, of which we have spoken in the explication of this Chapter, even as <hi>Rome</hi> is mystically called, <hi>c.</hi> 11.8. <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egipt,</hi> where also our Lord was crucified</p>
                  <p n="4">4. First Satan is said to deceive the Nations, and then to gather them together to battel against the Saints, which shews us, 1. That a false religion is ever cruel. And, 2. That whom he instigates thus to cruelty, he is but a deceiver of such, for they shall never get performed what there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they intend, and in the end shall work their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Where it is said, that their number was as the sand of the sea, we see that the Church has not only mighty, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies, but as <hi>Elisha</hi> said to <hi>Gehazi,</hi> there are more with her then against her, and if God only be with her, who can be against her to hurt her.</p>

Where it is said, that they compassed the camp of the Saints about, we see that the Saints and Church of Christ is still, and ever hath been, and shall be to the end the But of Satans malice, whereof she needs not to expect, either inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission or mitigation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.
